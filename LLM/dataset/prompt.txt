Understand this pattern and text properly

```
1. Situation 1
1. <think>
...
5. Model Thinks
... 
9. </think>
10. some question1
11. some question2 
....
26. some question[n]

2. Situation 2
1. <think>
...
8. Model Thinks
... 
14. </think>
15. some question1
16. some question2 
....
30. some question[n]

and so on
```

Patterns:
1. Each block separated by an empty line is a new situation.
2. Each sitation block has a global numbering of lines (of model's output) below the sitation line.

We want to parse this text and below are the 

Expected Outcomes:
0. Replace ** with "" empty string so that the markdown part goes away 
1. Remove the local numbering of the lines below the situation lines.
2. Remove all the text and lines in between 2 <think> and </think> including think html tags
3. Remove lines if they contain phrases in the beginning with "okay,", "here are", "here is", "here's", "these questions"
3. Renumber the local questions from 1 to n lines

This is the output required:
```
1. Situation 1
1. some question1
2. some question2 
....
n. some question[n]

2. Situation 2
1. some question1
2. some question2 
....
n. some question[n]

and so on
