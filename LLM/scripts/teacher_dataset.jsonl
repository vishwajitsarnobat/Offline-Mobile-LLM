{"instruction": "What items in my immediate surroundings could act as a makeshift stretcher or support?", "response": "**Immediate Action (while waiting for emergency help)**  \nIf you\u2019re alone and a friend, family member, or roommate collapses with chest pain and shortness of breath, the first priority is to get the person to a safe, flat surface and to keep them calm and still. A makeshift stretcher or support can help keep the person lying flat and reduce further strain on the heart. Below are common household items that can serve as a temporary support, plus step\u2011by\u2011step guidance on how to use them safely.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Flat, rigid boards or sheets  \n| Item | How to Use |\n|------|------------|\n| **Hard plastic or metal board** (e.g., a flat piece of wood from a toolbox, a folding step stool frame, a flat wooden pallet) | \u2022 Lay the board on a flat floor or a hard surface (carpet, hardwood, tile).<br>\u2022 Place the board under the back and chest of the person.<br>\u2022 If the board is too short, use two pieces side\u2011by\u2011side and tape or tie them together. |\n| **Large, stiff pillow or futon mattress** | \u2022 Roll it into a long, narrow strip.<br>\u2022 Position it under the person\u2019s back and chest, ensuring their spine stays neutral.<br>\u2022 If you have a couch or reclining chair, tilt it slightly and use the pillow to stabilize. |\n\n**Safety note:** Ensure the board or pillow is firm enough that the person won\u2019t sink into it, but not so hard that it causes discomfort. Do **not** try to move the person if you suspect a broken neck or spine; keep the head, neck, and spine in a neutral position until EMS arrives.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Upholstered furniture or cushions  \n| Item | How to Use |\n|------|------------|\n| **Cushions or bean\u2011bag chairs** | \u2022 Stack several cushions on top of each other to create a firm, flat surface.<br>\u2022 Place the stack under the collapsed individual\u2019s back and chest.<br>\u2022 Ensure the cushions are tightly pressed together so the person can\u2019t roll onto their stomach. |\n| **Large sofa or armchair** | \u2022 Sit the person upright on the armrest and then lay the sofa flat if possible.<br>\u2022 Use a blanket or towel to cover and support the chest area. |\n\n**Safety note:** Avoid soft foam mattresses or memory\u2011foam cushions alone\u2014they may give way under the body\u2019s weight. Combine with a rigid base when possible.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Clothing and textiles  \n| Item | How to Use |\n|------|------------|\n| **Heavy blankets, quilts, or duvets** | \u2022 Fold into a long strip.<br>\u2022 Place under the chest and upper back.<br>\u2022 If there\u2019s a sofa or a couch, place the blanket over the person\u2019s back and let the sofa support them. |\n| **Old t\u2011shirts or towels** | \u2022 Bundle several together to create a makeshift \u201cbackboard.\u201d<br>\u2022 Lay on a hard surface, then place the collapsed person on it. |\n\n**Safety note:** Ensure the textile does not constrict breathing or circulation. Keep the chest area open and not pressed tight.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Vehicles or hard surfaces  \n| Item | How to Use |\n|------|------------|\n| **Car floor** | \u2022 Slide the person flat onto the car floor.<br>\u2022 If the driver\u2019s seat is available, use the seat cushion as a backrest, leaving a slight incline. |\n| **Bike frame** | \u2022 If you have a sturdy bike, place the person on the seat and use the frame to support the upper body. |\n\n**Safety note:** These are last\u2011resort options. Do not attempt to move the person in a moving vehicle; the vehicle should be parked and turned off.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Steps for a Makeshift Support\n\n1. **Call 911 (or local emergency number) immediately** \u2013 Even if you\u2019re only a few steps away.  \n2. **Keep the person still** \u2013 Movement can worsen a heart attack.  \n3. **Position the chest and back flat** \u2013 Use a combination of a rigid board and a supportive blanket or cushion.  \n4. **Check for breathing and pulse** \u2013 If the person is breathing normally, keep them in a semi\u2011recumbent position (head slightly elevated).  \n5. **If breathing is labored, lay the person flat** \u2013 Place a pillow or rolled blanket under the head to keep the airway open.  \n6. **Monitor until EMS arrives** \u2013 Stay with them, reassure them, and keep the airway clear.\n\n---\n\n### What Not to Do\n\n- **Don\u2019t move the person if you suspect a broken neck or spine** \u2013 Keep the head, neck, and spine in a neutral position until medical help arrives.\n- **Avoid using very soft foam mattresses or cushions alone** \u2013 They can give way under weight and cause further strain.\n- **Never attempt to drive away with the person in an unstable vehicle** \u2013 Safety of both the patient and the driver must be prioritized.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n- **Flat, rigid boards or a solid stack of pillows** are the most reliable makeshift supports.  \n- **Heavy blankets or duvets** can provide cushioning and stability when combined with a rigid base.  \n- **Upholstered furniture** can be used as a backrest if the person is safe to sit upright.  \n\nAlways prioritize calling emergency services first; these makeshift supports are only temporary measures until professional help arrives. If you\u2019re unsure about the safety of a particular item or position, err on the side of caution and keep the person lying flat, supported, and still.", "context": "1.

Staff or security usually have a direct line to police. | Many hubs have intercoms that can be used to request help. |\n| **Security or maintenance office** | In multi\u2011unit buildings, the lobby security desk or maintenance office can call. | Call for emergency services or ask to be escorted to a nearby phone. |\n| **Police or fire station** | If you\u2019re within walking distance, head straight to the nearest police station or fire department. | They can provide immediate assistance. |\n\n**If none of these are within reasonable reach (e.g., you\u2019re in a remote area):**\n\n1. **Use a whistle or shout loudly** \u2013 try to attract attention from nearby residents, drivers, or anyone walking by.  \n2. **Draw attention with a mirror or any reflective surface** \u2013 a flash of light can attract drivers.  \n3. **Use any available vehicle radio or CB radio** \u2013 many emergency services have a dispatch frequency.  \n\n---\n\n## 3. Use a neighbor or passerby\n\n| How to reach out | What to say | Tips |\n|------------------|-------------|------|\n| **Go door\u2011to\u2011door** (if it\u2019s safe) | \u201cPlease help! I\u2019m having a stroke. I need an ambulance.\u201d | Be clear and concise; mention \u201cstroke\u201d and \u201cemergency.\u201d |\n| **Raise your voice** | \u201cHelp! Stroke! Call ambulance!\u201d | Loud, calm voice; avoid shouting for a long time, but keep them aware. |\n| **Point or gesture to a phone** | \u201cPlease use your phone to call 911.\u201d | A visual cue often works even if the person doesn\u2019t understand your language. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. While you\u2019re waiting, keep the patient comfortable and safe\n\n1. **Keep the airway clear** \u2013 if the patient coughs, try to help them clear any blockage.  \n2. **Monitor for worsening symptoms** \u2013 loss of consciousness, sudden chest pain, severe headache.  \n3. **Stay calm** \u2013 your composure helps the patient remain calmer.  \n4. **Do not move the patient unnecessarily** \u2013 unless they\u2019re at risk of falling or choking.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Once you\u2019ve located a phone or someone can call\n\n1. **Give a concise call to emergency services**  \n   - State the location (street name, landmark, building number).  \n   - Tell them the patient\u2019s symptoms (facial drooping, arm weakness, slurred speech).  \n   - Mention that you suspect a stroke.  \n   - Provide any additional details (time of onset, any known medical history if you have it).  \n\n2. **Follow dispatcher instructions** \u2013 they may give you specific first\u2011aid steps or ask you to stay with the patient until help arrives.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. If help still doesn\u2019t arrive within a short time\n\n- **Consider moving the patient to a safer or more public place** (e.g., a shop, bus stop, or open field).  \n- **Use a nearby vehicle\u2019s radio** (if you have access) \u2013 many cars have a CB or FM radio that can be used to contact emergency services.  \n\n---\n\n### Quick Summary\n\n1. **Secure the patient** (airway, side position, no food/drink).  \n2. **Locate an alternate phone** \u2013 public payphone, nearby store, office, police station, or use a whistle/shout to attract help.  \n3. **Call emergency services** (911, 999, 112, or local equivalent).  \n4. **Stay with the patient and monitor** until help arrives.  \n5. **If no phone is available, use visual or auditory signals** to attract nearby help.\n\n**Important:** A stroke is a medical emergency. If at any point the patient\u2019s condition worsens (e.g., stops breathing, becomes unconscious, severe chest pain), start CPR if trained and keep calling for help until professional assistance arrives.  \n\nIf you\u2019re in a situation where you can\u2019t physically reach a phone or attract help, seek the nearest person or building that can help. Always prioritize the patient\u2019s airway, breathing, and circulation while you wait for professional care.", "context": "2.

If no coughing and the infant cannot breathe or is gasping, move to the next step. |\n| **2. Position the infant** | \u2022 Hold the infant face\u2011down on your forearm, chest\u2011up. <br>\u2022 Keep the infant\u2019s head lower than their chest to allow the object to fall out. | If the infant is lying flat on a bed, place them on your lap or a stable surface, supporting their head. |\n| **3. Give 5 back\u2011blows** | \u2022 Using the heel of your hand, give firm blows between the infant\u2019s shoulder blades, just above the spine. <br>\u2022 Aim for 2\u20133\u202fcm depth and a force that compresses the chest enough to push the object upward. | Repeat exactly 5 times.

{"instruction": "Can I use my hands to press the sternum instead of abdominal thrusts?", "response": "**Short answer:**  \nFor a choking adult or child older than 1\u202fyear, the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts) is the recommended method. Pressing on the sternum (chest thrusts) is **not** the standard technique for adults and can be less effective and potentially harmful. It can be used only if you cannot safely reach the abdomen or if the person is very small or has a medical condition that makes abdominal thrusts unsafe.\n\n---\n\n## What to do if an adult or child (\u2265\u202f1\u202fyear) is choking\n\n| Step | Action | Why it works |\n|------|--------|--------------|\n| 1 | **Confirm choking** \u2013 ask \u201cCan you breathe?\u201d If they can\u2019t cough, speak, or make sound, they are choking. |\n| 2 | **Call emergency services** (911 in the U.S.) or ask someone else to do it. |\n| 3 | **Position yourself** \u2013 stand behind them.

Keep the pressure firm and steady. |\n| 2 | **Using fingers or hands to press** | Fingers are too small, can become contaminated, and give uneven pressure. | Use a folded piece of gauze or a bandage. Your hands should stay clean\u2014wear disposable gloves or a clean cloth if gloves aren\u2019t available. |\n| 3 | **Stopping pressure to \u201csee\u201d the wound** | Each time you lift the pressure, blood flows again and can overwhelm you. | Keep the pressure constant until the bleeding stops or you can apply a tourniquet. |\n| 4 | **Not elevating the limb** | Gravity increases blood flow to the area, making bleeding harder to control. | Raise the injured limb above heart level whenever possible, without moving the person\u2019s body. |\n| 5 | **Ignoring the possibility of a tourniquet** | For deep arterial cuts, pressure alone may be insufficient. | If bleeding is unstoppable after several minutes of firm pressure, apply a tourniquet **above** the wound (closer to the heart). |\n| 6 | **Applying a tourniquet incorrectly** | A loose or too tight tourniquet can cause tissue damage or insufficient control. | Tighten until the bleeding stops and the limb loses color. Mark the time on your watch; a tourniquet should never stay on longer than 2 hours. |\n| 7 | **Using too little force or too much force** | Light pressure won\u2019t stop arterial flow; too much can crush tissue or make it hard to assess the wound. | Apply steady, firm pressure\u2014like the amount needed to stop a normal cut\u2014until you see the blood stop or the limb becomes pale. |\n| 8 | **Not covering the wound afterward** | The wound can become contaminated and worsen. | After bleeding stops, cover with a sterile dressing or clean cloth and avoid moving the person\u2019s limb unnecessarily. |\n| 9 | **Failing to seek professional help** | Even if bleeding stops, arterial injuries often require stitches, antibiotics, or surgery. | Call emergency services right away or get the person to a hospital, even if you think the bleeding is under control. |\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011Step Quick\u2011Guide\n\n1. **Stay Calm & Protect Yourself**  \n   - Wear gloves if you have them; otherwise, use a clean cloth to avoid direct contact with blood.  \n   - Keep your hands clean to reduce infection risk.\n\n2. **Apply Direct Pressure**  \n   - Place a folded gauze or clean cloth over the *exact* bleeding edge.  \n   - Press firmly and steadily. Use the heel of your hand or a rolled bandage to maintain even pressure.\n\n3. **Elevate the Limb** (if possible)  \n   - Raise the injured limb above heart level without moving the entire body.  \n   - This reduces arterial blood flow.\n\n4. **Check for Success**  \n   - Do **not** lift the cloth to \u201ccheck.\u201d If the bleeding stops, the pressure is holding.  \n   - If bleeding continues for several minutes, proceed to a tourniquet.\n\n5. **Apply a Tourniquet (Last Resort)**  \n   - **Where?** 1\u20132 inches above the wound, closer to the heart.  \n   - **How?** Loop a cloth, belt, or commercial tourniquet; tighten until the bleeding stops and the limb turns pale.  \n   - **Time:** Note the time; do not keep a tourniquet on longer than 2 hours.\n\n6. **After Bleeding Stops**  \n   - Keep the pressure applied for at least 10\u201315 minutes to ensure the clot stays in place.  \n   - Gently remove the cloth, inspect the wound, and cover it with a sterile dressing or clean gauze.  \n   - Avoid moving the limb unnecessarily to prevent further injury.\n\n7. **Get Medical Attention**  \n   - Even if the bleeding has stopped, arterial lacerations usually need stitches, tetanus vaccination, antibiotics, or surgery.  \n   - Call emergency services or transport the person to the nearest hospital immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Checklist\n\n- **Clean hands / gloves** \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Direct pressure** \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Elevation** \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Tourniquet if needed** \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Keep pressure constant** \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Cover wound** \u2714\ufe0f  \n- **Seek professional care** \u2714\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n**Safety Warning:**  \nIf at any point the person shows signs of shock (pale, clammy skin, rapid heartbeat, fainting), or if the bleeding is uncontrolled, call emergency services (or have someone else do it) right away.

If the pressure doesn\u2019t stop the bleeding: <br>**Apply a **tourniquet** (only if you know how to use one safely): <br>\u2022 Wrap the tourniquet 3\u20134\u202finches above the wound (toward the heart). <br>\u2022 Tighten until the bleeding stops completely (usually a hard, steady \u201cclack\u201d). <br>\u2022 Write down the time you applied it. <br>\u2022 Do **not** let the tourniquet stay on longer than 1\u202fhour. | A tourniquet is the fastest way to halt arterial bleeding when pressure fails. | |\n| **6. After bleeding stops (pressure or tourniquet): <br>\u2022 If you used a tourniquet, **apply a sterile dressing** over the wound. <br>\u2022 If you still have a clean cloth, place it over the wound and keep it snug. <br>\u2022 Avoid removing any blood clots that have formed. | This protects the wound and keeps pressure on it while you wait for professional help. | |\n| **7. Keep the injured limb elevated (if possible)** | Elevation can reduce blood flow to the area, aiding hemostasis. | |\n| **8. Monitor the victim\u2019s vital signs (if you can): <br>\u2022 Check breathing, pulse, and level of consciousness. | You\u2019ll need this information for paramedics. | |\n| **9. Stay with the victim, keep them calm, and avoid moving the limb unless it\u2019s necessary to prevent further injury.** | Movement can aggravate bleeding and cause shock. | |\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n\n- **Do NOT** try to clean or trim the wound before stopping the bleeding.\n- **Do NOT** attempt to remove a clot or a tourniquet prematurely.\n- **Do NOT** use a tourniquet on a joint (e.g., knee, elbow) unless it\u2019s the only option; use a wide band if available.\n- **Do NOT** leave the tourniquet on for more than 1 hour\u2014if you must keep it on, tell paramedics the exact time it was applied.\n- **If you are unsure** how to apply a tourniquet, keep applying firm pressure and cover the wound as best you can while you wait for help.\n\n### When to Seek Immediate Professional Help\n\n- Bleeding doesn\u2019t stop after 5\u201310 minutes of direct pressure.\n- The person shows signs of shock: pale, cool, clammy skin; rapid heartbeat; shallow breathing; confusion or fainting.\n- The tourniquet has been in place for more than an hour.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nCall emergency services, apply firm pressure, use a tourniquet if necessary, keep the wound covered and the limb elevated, and wait for medical professionals.

{"instruction": "After the bleeding stops, what are the immediate follow\u2011up actions I should take to reduce scarring and promote healing?", "response": "**After the bleeding has stopped, follow these steps to help the wound heal well and keep scarring to a minimum.**\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clean the wound\n\n| Step | How to do it | Why it matters |\n|------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Wash hands** | Use soap and warm water for at least 20\u202fseconds. | Reduces risk of infection. |\n| **Remove debris** | Gently rinse the wound with cool, clean water. If visible dirt or grit remains, use a sterile saline solution (or make one by dissolving 1\u202ftsp salt in 1\u202fcup boiled water, cooled). | Keeps the wound clean without damaging new tissue. |\n| **Gentle cleansing** | Use a mild, fragrance\u2011free soap around the wound (not in it). Pat dry with a clean towel. | Avoids irritation and excess moisture. |\n| **Disinfect** | Apply an antiseptic that is safe for wounds (e.g., 0.5% povidone\u2011iodine or 0.5% chlorhexidine). Use a cotton swab or gauze; apply in a gentle, circular motion. | Reduces bacterial load. |\n\n> **Tip:** If you have a saline or sterile solution, you can soak a sterile gauze in it and apply it to the wound for a few minutes before wiping off any excess fluid.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply a sterile dressing\n\n| Option | How to do it | Best for |\n|--------|--------------|----------|\n| **Hydrocolloid or hydrogel dressing** | Place over the cleaned wound, ensuring it adheres to surrounding skin. | Keeps wound moist, promotes granulation, reduces scarring. |\n| **Non\u2011adherent dressing + adhesive bandage** | Put a non\u2011adherent pad (e.g., Tegaderm) over the wound, then secure with a sterile adhesive bandage. | Good for larger or deeper cuts that may need more support. |\n| **Sterile gauze + elastic wrap** | Layer gauze over the wound, then wrap with elastic bandage to provide light compression. | Useful if the cut is relatively straight and you want a simple wrap. |\n\n> **Compression** helps keep the wound edges close and reduces swelling, but don\u2019t wrap too tight\u2014avoid cutting off circulation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Keep the wound moist\n\n- **Moist wound healing** is key to minimizing scar tissue.\n- **Silicone gel sheets** or **silicone gels** can be applied after the wound has fully epithelialized (usually when the wound is closed or nearly closed). They help flatten and soften scars.\n- If you don\u2019t have silicone products, a thin layer of petroleum jelly (Vaseline) under a breathable dressing can also keep the area moist.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Protect from sun and friction\n\n1. **Cover** the healed area when outdoors. UV exposure can darken scars and make them more noticeable.\n2. **Use sunscreen** (SPF\u202f30+) on the scar after it has fully healed. Reapply every 2\u202fhours if exposed to sun.\n3. **Avoid tight clothing** or friction over the area while it\u2019s still healing.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Monitor for complications\n\n| Sign | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| Redness, warmth, swelling spreading beyond the wound, pus or foul odor | Treat as possible infection; seek medical help promptly. |\n| Fever or chills | Seek medical help. |\n| Increasing pain or bleeding | Seek urgent care. |\n| Scar that appears raised, painful, or very discolored | Consult a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for scar therapy. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. When to seek professional care\n\n- **Large or deep wounds** (\u22651\u202fcm in depth or width) should be evaluated by a healthcare professional, even if bleeding stops.\n- **Injuries on the face, hands, or joints** benefit from expert closure (sutures or staples) to preserve function and aesthetics.\n- **If you notice signs of infection** (see above) or the wound isn\u2019t healing within a week.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Long\u2011term scar management (optional but helpful)\n\n| Intervention | How to use it | Timing |\n|--------------|---------------|--------|\n| **Silicone gel sheets** | Place over the scar once it\u2019s fully closed. Leave on for 12\u201324\u202fhrs daily. | Start after wound closure, continue for 3\u20136\u202fmonths. |\n| **Steroid injections** | Performed by a dermatologist; reduces hypertrophic scars. | After scar has formed and is thick or raised. |\n| **Massage & pressure garments** | Gentle massage with a light, non\u2011stick lotion. | Daily, after scar is mature. |\n| **Laser therapy** | Performed in a clinic; can improve redness and texture. | After several months of healing. |\n\n---\n\n### Quick Summary\n\n1. **Clean** \u2192 **Disinfect** \u2192 **Dress** (keep moist).  \n2. **Cover** to protect from sun/friction.  \n3. **Check** daily for redness, warmth, or drainage.  \n4. **Seek help** if infection or bleeding recurs.  \n5. **Apply silicone** products once the wound is closed to smooth the scar.  \n\nBy following these steps, you give the wound the best chance to heal with minimal scarring and keep it functional and safe. If at any point you\u2019re unsure or notice worsening symptoms, don\u2019t delay\u2014contact a healthcare professional.", "context": "4.

Stop the arterial bleeding\n\n| Step | Action | Why it matters |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| **A** | **Apply direct, firm pressure** | Pressure compresses the artery and forces the clotting cascade to begin. |\n| **B** | Use a **clean cloth or clothing** (towel, sock, T\u2011shirt, bandana). If you have a piece of medical gauze or a clean sheet, that\u2019s even better. | The cleaner and thicker the material, the more blood it can soak and the better the pressure. |\n| **C** | **Elevate the limb** (if the injury is on an arm or leg). | Raising the limb reduces blood flow to the area. |\n| **D** | **Wrap the cloth around the wound** and tie it snugly, but not so tight that it cuts off circulation to the hand or foot. | Tightening creates a seal and prevents the bleeding from re\u2011starting. |\n| **E** | **Hold the pressure for at least 10\u201315 minutes**. If you can\u2019t keep it on, have someone help or use your body weight (lean against a wall, sit in a chair, etc.). | Arteries can bleed quickly; persistent pressure is often all you need to control it. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Clean the wound\n\n| Item | How to Use | Notes |\n|------|------------|-------|\n| **Clean water** | Rinse the wound gently with the cleanest water you have (tap water that\u2019s been boiled or filtered). | If you have no access to clean water, a splash of any clean liquid will help remove debris. |\n| **Boiled water** | Bring water to a rolling boil for 3\u20135\u202fminutes, then let it cool. Use it to rinse the wound. | Boiling kills most bacteria, giving you a semi\u2011sterile rinse. |\n| **Salt (table salt or sea salt)** | Dissolve 1\u202ftsp salt in 1\u202fcup boiled water to create a mild saline solution. Rinse the wound with this. | Salt is mildly antiseptic and helps draw out bacteria. |\n| **Vinegar (apple cider or white)** | Dilute 1\u202fpart vinegar with 3\u202fparts water and use it to wipe the wound. | Vinegar can kill some bacteria, but don\u2019t use it on open wounds if you\u2019re unsure\u2014boiled water is safer. |\n| **Alcohol (if you have it)** | Use 70\u202f% isopropyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol to clean the area around the wound (not the wound itself). | Alcohol kills surface bacteria but can be irritating. |\n| **Dish soap** | Use a very small amount of gentle dish soap to clean skin around the wound before covering it. | Don\u2019t lather inside the wound; just cleanse the surrounding skin. |\n\n**Cleaning Steps:**\n1. **Wash your hands** with soap and water if possible, or with an alcohol wipe.\n2. **Rinse the wound** with boiled water or a mild saline solution, gently blowing or patting to remove debris. Avoid scrubbing.\n3. **Pat the area dry** with a clean cloth or sterile gauze (or a clean, unused piece of clothing).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Prepare an improvised sterile dressing\n\n| Household Item | How to Convert into a Dressing | Tips |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|------|\n| **Clean cloth, T\u2011shirt, or towel** | Cut into a square or rectangle large enough to cover the wound. If you have a clean cotton shirt, cut off a square of fabric. | Ensure it\u2019s clean, dry, and free of holes. |\n| **Plastic bag or zip\u2011lock bag** | Cut a hole in the bag, invert it, and slide the wound into the bag, then press the bag over the wound to create a seal. | Acts as a temporary \u201cgauze\u201d and helps keep the wound dry. |\n| **Clean socks or stockings** | Cut off the toe area, flatten it, and use as a pad. | Socks are often soft and absorbent. |\n| **Paper towels or clean kitchen paper** | Flatten and use as a pad; combine with a clean cloth. | Not ideal for long\u2011term use, but good for initial coverage. |\n| **Hairband, shoelace, or elastic band** | Use as a makeshift tourniquet *only* if you\u2019re sure the bleeding can\u2019t be stopped by direct pressure and no other options exist. | **Never use a tourniquet unless absolutely necessary** \u2013 it can cause tissue damage. |\n\n**Assembly Steps:**\n1. **Make a pad**: Lay a clean piece of cloth on a flat surface and cut it to size. If using a plastic bag, invert it and place the wound inside.\n2. **Cover the wound**: Place the pad over the cleaned wound, ensuring it\u2019s fully covered and that the edges overlap slightly with the surrounding skin.\n3. **Secure the dressing**: Tie a clean piece of cloth, a hairband, or a shoelace around the wound and the pad. Make sure the dressing stays snug but does not cut off circulation. A second strip on the opposite side can keep it in place.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Final steps\n\n1. **Reapply pressure** if bleeding starts again. Keep the dressing in place while you do this.\n2. **Keep the limb elevated** (if on an arm/leg) and avoid moving the injured area.\n3. **Seek professional medical care** as soon as possible. Even if the bleeding stops, arterial lacerations can have deep tissue damage, require stitches, or need antibiotics to prevent infection.\n4. **Monitor for signs of infection** in the next 24\u201348\u202fhours: increasing redness, warmth, swelling, pus, or a fever.\n\n---\n\n### Quick \u201cEmergency Cheat\u2011Sheet\u201d\n\n| Problem | Immediate Fix | Where to get it |\n|---------|--------------|-----------------|\n| **Arterial bleeding** | Direct pressure + clean cloth | Any T\u2011shirt, towel, or kitchen cloth |\n| **Wound cleaning** | Boiled water, salt solution, or vinegar | Boil water in a pot or kettle |\n| **Sterile pad** | Clean cloth cut to size, plastic bag cut into a pocket | Clean cloth, plastic bag, or even a paper towel |\n| **Securing dressing** | Clean elastic band, shoelace, or hairband | Any elastic, lace, or hairband |\n| **Antiseptic** | Boiled water + salt, diluted vinegar (optional) | Kitchen supplies |\n\n---\n\n**Remember**: The goal is to **control the bleeding** first, then **clean** and **cover** the wound to reduce infection risk. Even the best homemade dressing isn\u2019t as effective as medical gauze or a proper antiseptic, but it can make a huge difference while you wait for help.\n\n**If at any point the bleeding does not stop or you\u2019re unable to maintain pressure, call emergency services right away.** Your safety is the top priority.", "context": "4.

Confirm the Tourniquet Is Applied Correctly\n\n1. **Position** \u2013 The tourniquet should be 2\u20133\u202fcm above the wound (on the limb), not over a joint, and fully circumferential.  \n2. **Tightness** \u2013 It must be tight enough that you can\u2019t see or feel pulse distal to the tourniquet. If you can still see or feel a pulse, tighten it further.  \n3. **Release Point** \u2013 If you accidentally release it, it should not be re\u2011applied until you\u2019re sure it\u2019s needed and properly positioned.  \n4. **Check** \u2013 If the tourniquet is loose or on the wrong side of the wound, re\u2011apply it in the correct position.\n\n*If the tourniquet is **properly** applied but bleeding still pours, you\u2019re likely dealing with a high\u2011pressure arterial bleed that needs more immediate pressure or packing.*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Apply Direct, Sustained Pressure Over the Wound\n\n1. **Sterile Gauze or Clean Cloth** \u2013 Place a clean, wide piece directly over the bleeding site.  \n2. **Pressure** \u2013 Push firmly with both hands (or a third person if available).  \n3. **Hold** \u2013 Maintain the pressure for at least 5\u201310\u202fminutes. Do **not** remove the pressure until help arrives or you\u2019re instructed otherwise.\n\n> **Tip:** If you\u2019re alone, you can press with your elbows or knees if the arm/leg is out of reach.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Pack the Wound (If the Bleeding is Still Heavy)\n\n1. **Fold Gauze** \u2013 Take a few strips of gauze and fold them into a \u201cpillow\u201d shape.  \n2. **Insert** \u2013 Gently push the gauze into the wound, aiming to fill the cavity without forcing it too deep (which can worsen bleeding).  \n3. **Apply Pressure Again** \u2013 Press the packed gauze with a fresh dressing or bandage on top.  \n4. **Maintain** \u2013 Keep pressure until help arrives or the bleeding stops.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Use a Hemostatic Agent (If Available)\n\n1. **Products** \u2013 Common emergency hemostatic agents include *QuikClot*, *Celox*, or *Hemopatch*.  \n2. **Apply** \u2013 Follow the product instructions exactly: usually spread the powder over the wound and pack it with gauze.  \n3. **Press** \u2013 Apply firm pressure for the recommended time (often 5\u201310\u202fminutes).  \n\n> **Note:** If you have a hemostatic agent, it\u2019s usually more effective than plain gauze alone for arterial bleeding.\n\n---\n\n## 5. If Bleeding Continues, Try a Second Tourniquet Higher Up\n\n1. **Locate a Higher Site** \u2013 For an arm, put the second tourniquet on the upper arm; for a leg, on the upper thigh.  \n2. **Apply** \u2013 Tighten it firmly, then immediately re\u2011apply pressure to the wound as described above.  \n3. **Keep the First Tourniquet** \u2013 Do not remove the first one; it may still be helping to reduce blood loss.\n\n> **Caution:** The second tourniquet should only be applied if the first is inadequate and you\u2019re confident you\u2019re not causing further injury.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Keep the Limb Elevated (If Possible)\n\n- **Elevate** the injured limb above heart level using a pillow or a makeshift stretcher.  \n- **Caution:** Elevation is most helpful for venous bleeding; for arterial bleeding, the priority is pressure, but elevation can still help reduce flow.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Monitor the Victim\n\n| What to Watch For | Why It Matters |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| **Level of consciousness** | Loss of consciousness can signal shock or severe blood loss. |\n| **Breathing** | Rapid or shallow breathing indicates distress. |\n| **Skin color & temperature** | Pale, clammy skin can mean shock. |\n| **Pulse rate** | Tachycardia (fast heart rate) may indicate shock. |\n\n*If the victim shows signs of shock (cool, clammy skin; rapid pulse; dizziness), keep them lying flat, elevate the legs slightly (if not contraindicated), and cover them with a blanket.*\n\n---\n\n## 8. Do Not Remove the Tourniquet or Pack Until Help Arrives\n\n- **Leave it in place**\u2014removing it can cause a sudden gush of blood.  \n- **Wait** for emergency responders, who will know when and how to safely remove it.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Stay Calm and Reassure the Victim\n\n- Speak softly, keep the victim awake, and let them know help is on the way.  \n- Avoid letting them move the injured limb unless absolutely necessary.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Final Reminder\n\n- **Call emergency services now** if you haven\u2019t already.  \n- If you are in a remote area, inform the dispatcher of the exact location, the severity of the bleed, and any first\u2011aid measures you\u2019ve already taken.  \n- Once professionals arrive, hand over the situation with clear, concise information: \u201cMajor arterial bleed, tourniquet applied 5\u202fcm above the wound, direct pressure ongoing, still bleeding heavily.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \n- **Call for help** right away.  \n- **Ensure the tourniquet is tight and correctly positioned.**  \n- **Apply direct, sustained pressure** and, if needed, **pack the wound**.  \n- **Use a hemostatic agent** if you have one.  \n- **Never remove a tourniquet** until emergency personnel tell you to.  \n\nThese steps are the safest, most effective measures you can take in a life\u2011threatening bleeding situation.

Pick the Closest One** | The app will list options with distances. Tap the one with the shortest distance or the highest rating. | Note the address or landmark the app shows. |\n| **5. Start Navigation** | Tap \u201cDirections\u201d or \u201cNavigate.\u201d The app will use GPS to give turn\u2011by\u2011turn directions. | Keep the screen on or set the phone to \u201cAlways On\u201d if possible. |\n\n**Why this works:** Offline map data is stored locally on your phone. GPS still receives satellite signals, so the app can calculate your route using that stored map layer.\n\n---\n\n## 2. If the Map App Fails to Show a Hospital\n\n| Step | What to Do | Tips |\n|------|------------|------|\n| **1. Check for \u201cMedical\u201d Layers** | Some apps allow you to toggle a \u201cMedical\u201d or \u201cHealth\u201d layer. Enable it. | This can surface nearby clinics that didn\u2019t appear in a generic search. |\n| **2. Use a Cached \u201cNearby\u201d Feature** | Many map apps cache a list of \u201cNearby\u201d points of interest. Scroll through the list until you see a medical facility. | The list is usually alphabetized by distance. |\n| **3. Turn on \u201cSatellite\u201d View** | Satellite imagery may reveal a hospital\u2019s distinctive building layout. | You can sometimes identify a large white structure or a parking lot with an ambulance entrance. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Use GPS Directly (Without a Map App)\n\n| Step | What to Do | Tips |\n|------|------------|------|\n| **1. Open Your Phone\u2019s Compass/Navigation Widget** | Most smartphones have a compass app that shows cardinal directions and distance to the current location. | Some devices also show \u201cDistance to Home\u201d or \u201cDistance to GPS Anchor.\u201d |\n| **2. Look for the \u201cNearest Hospital\u201d on a Pre\u2011Downloaded List** | If you downloaded a PDF or text file with local hospital addresses, scroll to the nearest one. | Write the address on a piece of paper or keep it on your phone\u2019s lock screen for quick reference. |\n| **3. Walk Straight Toward the Direction Indicated** | Use the compass to orient yourself, then walk toward the direction of the nearest hospital. | Keep your phone close to your chest to maintain a stable GPS lock. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. While You\u2019re On the Way (or If You\u2019re Stuck)\n\n| Step | What to Do | Tips |\n|------|------------|------|\n| **1. Ask for Help** | Approach a passerby, shop owner, or street vendor and explain you\u2019re experiencing an allergic reaction. | Even if you can\u2019t explain the severity, saying \u201cI need a doctor\u201d often gets a response. |\n| **2. Use a Text Message to a Friend or Family Member** | If you can\u2019t call, send a text: \u201cI\u2019m having an allergic reaction. Need help.\u201d | Many services can respond to a text or offer to call emergency services on your behalf. |\n| **3. Keep Your Phone Charged** | If you\u2019re in a car, use a USB charger. If you\u2019re on foot, find a public phone or caf\u00e9. | A low battery can cut you off from navigation and communication. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. In Case of No Offline Map Availability\n\n| Step | What to Do | Tips |\n|------|------------|------|\n| **1. Find a Landmark** | Look for a major intersection, highway entrance, or a large commercial building. | These often serve as waypoints toward a hospital. |\n| **2. Use Local Knowledge** | If you\u2019re in a city or town, the nearest \u201chospital\u201d is usually a recognizable building. | Hospitals often have a white cross logo, a large sign, or a distinctive architecture. |\n| **3. Walk to the Nearest Public Building** | Schools, post offices, or police stations are often close to hospitals and can help you. | They usually have a phone or can call emergency services for you. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Safety Warning & Quick Takeaway\n\n1. **Call Emergency Services ASAP** \u2013 Even if you\u2019re unsure how to locate a hospital, dialing your local emergency number will connect you with trained professionals who can dispatch an ambulance to your exact location.\n2. **Seek Immediate Help if You\u2019re Breathing Difficulty** \u2013 Do not wait for navigation to finish if your breathing is impaired. Ask someone to call 911 for you.\n3. **Carry an EpiPen if You\u2019re at Risk** \u2013 If you have a prescription, bring it on you at all times and use it immediately before seeking medical help.\n4. **Use Offline Maps Only as a Backup** \u2013 They\u2019re helpful if you\u2019re mobile and the phone\u2019s battery is decent, but they\u2019re not a substitute for a professional medical response.\n\n**Bottom line:** Try to get professional help right away. Use your phone\u2019s offline map or GPS to guide you, but do not delay calling emergency services. Your life is the priority.", "context": "6.

{"instruction": "How can I position myself or a loved one to maximize airway opening and breathing?", "response": "**Immediate priority:** Get medical help right away. If you can\u2019t reach a phone, have someone else call 911 (or your local emergency number) now. Anaphylaxis can progress rapidly; even a short delay can be life\u2011threatening.\n\nBelow are practical steps you can take while you\u2019re waiting for help, or if you\u2019re unable to call right now. These measures can help keep the airway open and give your body a better chance to respond to the reaction.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Positioning to keep the airway open\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **Sit upright or kneel on the floor** | Sit with back straight, feet flat on the ground, or kneel with hands on the knees. | This keeps the throat from sagging and reduces pressure on the airway. |\n| **Elevate the head and upper body** | If you can, propping the torso on a chair, bed, or stack of cushions, keep the head a few inches higher than the stomach. | Elevation helps the diaphragm and reduces the risk of airway collapse. |\n| **Keep the head slightly forward (chin up)** | Tilt the head forward enough so that the mouth stays open and the tongue doesn\u2019t block the pharynx. | This keeps the airway clear and prevents the tongue from falling back. |\n| **Avoid lying flat on the back** | Lying supine can let the tongue or swollen tissues block the airway. | Staying upright or semi\u2011upright keeps the airway more patent. |\n\n**If you\u2019re alone:**  \n- Sit on the edge of a chair or a table with your knees bent and feet flat.  \n- Place a pillow, book, or folded blanket under your shoulders to help elevate the upper body slightly.\n\n**If you\u2019re with a loved one or a caregiver:**  \n- They can help you maintain this posture, but avoid putting any weight on your neck or back that could compress the airway.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Breathing technique\n\n| Technique | How to do it | Note |\n|-----------|--------------|------|\n| **Slow, controlled breaths** | Inhale slowly through the nose, hold for a second, then exhale slowly through the mouth. Aim for 5\u20116 breaths per minute. | Helps avoid hyperventilation and keeps the airway muscles relaxed. |\n| **If you can\u2019t breathe comfortably:** | Use a small, soft cloth or your hand as a gentle \u201csplint\u201d against the jaw to keep the mouth open. | Only if you can do it without straining or feeling pain. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Monitor symptoms and communicate\n\n- **Check pulse, breathing rate, and level of consciousness** every 2\u20133 minutes.  \n- **Describe symptoms clearly** to the dispatcher or emergency responder: e.g., swelling in lips/face, difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest tightness.  \n- **Tell them you have no epinephrine auto\u2011injector.** The dispatcher may give you verbal instructions to help keep the airway open.\n\n---\n\n## 4. If you notice the reaction worsening\n\n| Warning sign | Action |\n|--------------|--------|\n| Rapid swelling of face or throat, feeling of choking, or a sudden drop in consciousness | Call 911 immediately (or ask someone else). If the person is unconscious, begin CPR if trained. |\n| Onset of wheezing, severe shortness of breath, or tightness in the chest | Keep the airway open as above and keep calling for help. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. After help arrives\n\n- **Do not start medications or treatments** yourself\u2014let the medical team decide.  \n- **Inform the responders** that you had an anaphylactic reaction and that you have no epinephrine auto\u2011injector.  \n- **Ask for a prescription** for an epinephrine auto\u2011injector (EpiPen\u00ae, Auvi-Q\u00ae, or others) and a written action plan for future episodes.\n\n---\n\n### Key Take\u2011away\n1. **Call emergency services now.**  \n2. **Sit or kneel upright, elevate the upper body, and keep the head forward.**  \n3. **Breathe slowly and stay calm.**  \n4. **Keep monitoring and be ready to describe changes to the dispatcher.**  \n\n**If you are ever in doubt about your breathing or the severity of the reaction, err on the side of caution and treat it as an emergency.**", "context": "6.

If the child is actively seizing, or if you\u2019re unsure of how to keep them safe, call emergency services (911 or your local number) first. The instructions below are for a situation where the child is stable (post\u2011seizure, alert, or under supervision) and you need a rapid blood test.**  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Prepare & Protect\n\n| Step | Action | Why |\n|------|--------|-----|\n| **1. Wash hands** | Use soap & water or an alcohol\u2011based hand sanitizer. | Prevent contamination & infection. |\n| **2. Put on gloves** | One disposable pair (latex or nitrile). | Protect you & the child. |\n| **3. Gather supplies** | \u2022 Sterile lancet (size 5\u20137) with safety guard<br>\u2022 Alcohol swab or 70\u202f% isopropyl solution<br>\u2022 Blood collection device (glucose test strip or lactate test cartridge)<br>\u2022 Small plastic cap for the lancet<br>\u2022 A clean, flat surface (tray or towel)<br>\u2022 Optional: cotton ball or gauze | Everything you need in one place. |\n| **4. Read the test kit** | Confirm the required sample volume (usually 0.2\u20130.5\u202fmL). | Ensures you collect enough blood. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Choose the Right Site\n\n| Finger | Notes |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Index or middle finger (dorsal side)** | Usually the best balance of size and comfort. |\n| **Avoid the thumb** | Can be more painful and sometimes harder to clean. |\n| **Select the same finger for future tests** | Reduces scar tissue and pain. |\n\n*Tip*: If the child is very young or has a large hand, consider the thumb for an easier approach, but be mindful of the pain.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Clean the Skin\n\n1. **Wet the alcohol swab** \u2013 do not let it drip.\n2. **Wipe the selected fingertip** in a circular motion, from the pad toward the tip, for at least 15\u202fseconds.\n3. **Let the site air\u2011dry** \u2013 do *not* pat it dry; dried alcohol improves lancet penetration and reduces contamination.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Perform the Lancing\n\n1. **Hold the lancet device** with your thumb on the top guard and fingers on the bottom, forming a \u201cC\u201d shape around the tip of the finger.\n2. **Place the protected tip of the lancet** firmly against the cleaned spot on the fingertip.\n3. **Press down firmly** \u2013 the lancet will automatically release and puncture the skin.\n4. **Remove the lancet** quickly. If you\u2019re using a safety device, slide the guard back along the lancet to cover the needle.\n\n*Safety note*: Never use a needle or lancet that\u2019s damaged or older than its expiry date. Always use a new, sterile device for each child.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Collect the Blood Drop\n\n1. **Press the side of the finger** (not the tip) lightly to encourage blood flow. Avoid squeezing the finger too hard\u2014this can dilute the sample with interstitial fluid.\n2. **Let a drop form** on the pad or the side of the finger. The drop should be **solid and not too large** (ideally about 0.2\u202fmL for lactate, 0.5\u202fmL for glucose).\n3. **Avoid touching the drop** with your hand or the cotton ball. If it gets touched, discard the drop and start over.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Apply the Blood to the Test Device\n\n| Device | How to apply |\n|--------|--------------|\n| **Glucose meter** | Place the drop on the test strip\u2019s adhesive pad. The meter will read automatically. |\n| **Point\u2011of\u2011care lactate meter** | Some lactate meters use a cartridge that requires the drop to be pipetted. If the kit supplies a pipette, use it. Otherwise, some meters allow direct application of a drop onto the cartridge\u2019s sample port. Follow the specific manufacturer\u2019s instructions. |\n| **Blood collection tube (fluoride for lactate)** | If you\u2019re using a tube, gently touch the drop to the opening of the tube; the drop should fall in. Some tubes have a cap to prevent evaporation. |\n\n**Do NOT** use a cotton ball to \u201ccollect\u201d the drop and then transfer it. The cotton can absorb glucose and alter the reading.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Post\u2011Sampling Care\n\n1. **Apply gentle pressure** to the puncture site for 15\u201330\u202fseconds to stop bleeding. Use a small gauze or cotton ball.\n2. **If the child is nervous or crying, offer a small reward** (a sticker, a favorite snack) after the procedure to make it a positive experience.\n3. **Store the sample** (if not used immediately) in a clean, sealed container at room temperature for lactate or at 4\u202f\u00b0C if the analysis is delayed (lactate is unstable at room temperature). **Do not freeze** unless specified by your lab protocol.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Read & Record the Result\n\n1. **Wait for the meter to signal completion** (usually 10\u201330\u202fseconds).\n2. **Write down the value** and the time of sampling on a chart or the patient\u2019s record.\n3. **Take immediate action** based on the reading:\n   - **Glucose**: If < 60\u202fmg/dL (or < 3.3\u202fmmol/L), give a fast\u2011acting carbohydrate (e.g., glucose gel, juice). If > 200\u202fmg/dL, seek urgent care.\n   - **Lactate**: Elevated lactate (> 2\u202fmmol/L) in a feverish child can indicate sepsis or severe infection\u2014call for immediate medical assessment.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Safety & When to Seek Help\n\n| Situation | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Child still seizing or appears unresponsive | **Stop the test.** Secure the airway, call emergency services immediately. |\n| Blood is heavily contaminated or the child shows signs of infection at the puncture site (redness, swelling) | **Discontinue sampling.** Use a new site if needed; monitor for infection. |\n| Child becomes overly distressed or refuses to cooperate | **Pause the test.** Use a distraction technique (music, a favorite toy) and try again later. |\n| Results indicate severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia | **Immediate medical care is required.** Do not wait for a clinic visit. |\n\n---\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Clean, sterile technique** \u2013 wash, glove, alcohol wipe, new lancet.\n2. **Gentle, controlled puncture** \u2013 avoid squeezing the finger too hard.\n3. **Correct drop size** \u2013 too large or too small can skew results.\n4. **Immediate action** \u2013 interpret results quickly and act per protocol.\n5. **Child safety first** \u2013 if the child is actively seizing or is unsafe, call emergency services before sampling.\n\n**You can do this safely with calmness, proper hygiene, and attention to the child\u2019s comfort.** If you\u2019re ever unsure, it\u2019s better to err on the side of caution and seek professional medical help.", "context": "7.

If you\u2019re unsure, call a pharmacist or your doctor before administering more.\n\n---\n\n### When the child is vomiting repeatedly\n\n| Action | Why |\n|--------|-----|\n| **Stop oral medication** | Vomiting after each dose means the drug won\u2019t be absorbed and may worsen dehydration. |\n| **Check for oral/respiratory obstruction** | If the child has a foreign body or swelling, it can mimic vomiting. |\n| **Offer small oral rehydration solutions** | ORS contains the right balance of electrolytes and glucose. |\n| **Consider IV fluids** | If vomiting persists and the child looks dehydrated (sunken eyes, dry mouth, no tears when crying), an IV line may be necessary. |\n| **Seek urgent medical care** | Persistent vomiting + high fever + lethargy = a potential bacterial infection (e.g., meningitis, sepsis). |\n\n---\n\n### Signs that demand **immediate medical evaluation**\n\n- The child is **unresponsive** or only awake when stimulated.\n- The child has a **febrile seizure** that lasts longer than 5 minutes or has more than one seizure in 24\u202fh.\n- The child\u2019s breathing is **rapid, shallow, or labored** (shortness of breath, grunting).\n- The child\u2019s skin is **pale, clammy, or blue\u2011tinted** (especially around lips/face).\n- **Vomiting is persistent** (after every dose) or the child cannot keep any fluids down.\n- The child\u2019s **temperature stays above 104\u202f\u00b0F (40\u202f\u00b0C)** despite antipyretics.\n- The child is **severe lethargic** or has trouble staying awake.\n\n---\n\n### Quick \u201cfirst\u2011aid\u201d checklist\n\n1. **Call 911 / local emergency number.**  \n2. Keep the child **lying flat**; elevate legs slightly if breathing is difficult.  \n3. **Do not give more oral medication**; offer small sips of ORS if the child can keep liquids down.  \n4. **Monitor breathing and level of consciousness**; if the child drowses or stops breathing, prepare to perform rescue breathing or CPR.  \n5. **Document**: last medication dose/time, temperature, vomiting, seizure details.  \n6. **Stay with the child** until help arrives.  \n\n---\n\n### After you get to the hospital\n\n- Let the healthcare team know the **exact medication dose**, timing, and any symptoms.  \n- They will likely give **IV fluids** and possibly a higher\u2011dose or alternative antipyretic.  \n- If the fever is due to a bacterial infection (e.g., meningitis, pneumonia), they may start **IV antibiotics**.  \n- The team will monitor for seizures and treat them if they occur.  \n\n---\n\n#### Bottom line\n\nIf the child is vomiting after each dose of medication and has a high fever, lethargy, or seizures, **do not wait**. Call emergency services immediately. Keep the child hydrated, monitor breathing, and provide as much information as possible to the responders.

{"instruction": "How long should I keep the patient immobilized before moving them to a car or ambulance?", "response": "### Short answer  \n**Keep the patient immobilized for as long as possible\u2014until professional medical help arrives or until you can safely transfer them without risking further spinal injury.**  \nThere is no set \u201ctime limit\u201d (e.g., 10\u202fmin, 30\u202fmin, 1\u202fhour). The goal is to **maintain spinal alignment until the spine can be examined by trained personnel**.\n\n---\n\n## Step\u2011by\u2011step guidance for the layperson\n\n| Step | What to do | Why it matters |\n|------|------------|----------------|\n| **1. Call for help immediately** | Dial emergency services (911 in the U.S., 999 in the U.K., etc.). | Professional EMTs are trained in spinal stabilization and will arrive with proper equipment. |\n| **2. Don\u2019t move the patient unless absolutely necessary** | Keep the head, neck, and torso aligned on a rigid board or a flat surface. | Every movement can cause the spinal column to shift, potentially worsening a fracture or causing paralysis. |\n| **3. Apply a cervical collar (if available)** | - Gently place the collar around the patient\u2019s neck. <br>- Make sure it\u2019s snug but not too tight. | Stabilizes the cervical spine, the most vulnerable part of the spine. |\n| **4. Place the patient on a backboard or a rigid flat surface** | - Lay the patient on their back. <br>- Use a rigid board (a board, a long, flat piece of wood, or a sturdy chair). <br>- If no board is available, keep them flat on the ground with a rigid object (e.g., a folded jacket, a blanket). | A rigid surface prevents the spine from flexing, bending, or twisting. |\n| **5. Secure the patient** | - Use straps, rope, or even towels to keep the patient tied to the board. <br>- If you cannot use straps, hand\u2011hold the patient\u2019s arms and legs in a neutral position. | Prevents unintended movement during transport or while waiting. |\n| **6. Keep the patient\u2019s airway open and breathing** | - If the patient is conscious: tilt the head back slightly, lift the chin. <br>- If unconscious: perform a jaw\u2011thrust maneuver (not a chin lift) to avoid neck flexion. | Ensures oxygen delivery while keeping the neck stable. |\n| **7. Monitor vital signs (if possible)** | - Check pulse, breathing, and consciousness level. <br>- Look for signs of shock (pale, clammy skin, rapid breathing). | Helps you know if the patient is deteriorating and needs urgent transfer. |\n| **8. Prepare for safe transfer** | - When EMS arrives, hand over the patient with clear instructions: \u201cSuspected spinal injury \u2013 keep immobilized.\u201d <br>- If you must move the patient (e.g., vehicle is at risk of collapse), use the **log\u2011roll technique**: <br>  1. Place one hand on the patient\u2019s forehead and the other under their chin. <br>  2. Slowly rotate the patient\u2019s body while keeping the head, neck, and spine in a straight line. <br>  3. Do the same with the legs, keeping the spine aligned. | Minimizes bending or twisting of the spine. |\n| **9. Keep the patient immobilized until it\u2019s safe to move** | \u2013 If the patient is stable and the environment is safe, keep them on the board. <br> \u2013 If you must relocate them to a vehicle, keep the board on the back of the seat and secure it firmly. | Avoid unnecessary movement; each motion is a risk. |\n\n---\n\n## When and why you should **stop** immobilizing\n\n| Condition | What to do |\n|-----------|------------|\n| **Emergency medical services arrive** | Hand over the patient with full briefing. They will remove or adjust immobilization as needed. |\n| **Patient shows signs of severe distress** | If they lose consciousness, breathing stops, or you see obvious life\u2011threatening signs, move them immediately **only if** the environment is unsafe (e.g., vehicle is about to roll). In that case, use the log\u2011roll technique. |\n| **You are the only person present and no professional help is available** | Keep the patient immobilized for as long as possible. Transport them slowly, keeping the board in place. The priority is *not* to rush; moving too fast can cause further injury. |\n\n---\n\n## Key safety reminders\n\n1. **Never lift the patient\u2019s head or neck.** Even a small twist can worsen a spinal injury.\n2. **Avoid \u201cchin lift\u201d** if the patient is unconscious. Use jaw\u2011thrust.\n3. **Do not remove the cervical collar or backboard** until EMTs or a doctor explicitly instructs you to do so.\n4. **If you feel unsafe** (e.g., the vehicle is unstable), call emergency services again and ask for an on\u2011scene assessment.\n5. **Check the patient\u2019s breathing** every 2\u20133 minutes if possible. If breathing stops, perform CPR (if trained) and call for help immediately.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Keep the patient immobilized for as long as possible.**  \n- **Wait for professional help** to arrive and to perform the safe transfer.  \n- **Move only when absolutely necessary** and use the log\u2011roll technique to preserve spinal alignment.\n\nIf you have any doubt or the patient\u2019s condition changes, call emergency services again and explain the urgency.

Scene Safety & Assessment\n\n| Step | Action | Why |\n|------|--------|-----|\n| **1** | Make sure the area is safe (no falling debris, traffic, fire, etc.) | Prevent additional injuries. |\n| **2** | Check for responsiveness, breathing, and pulse. | Determines the urgency of treatment. |\n| **3** | If the person is unconscious or in obvious pain, **do not** move them. | Minimizes risk of worsening a spinal injury. |\n| **4** | Call emergency services. | Professional help is essential. |\n| **5** | If you must move them (e.g., to avoid fire or collapse), do it slowly, keeping the head and neck in a neutral position. | Reduces spinal movement. |\n\n> **If the person is conscious and able to sit upright, you can begin immobilization while you wait for EMS.**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Preparing the \u201cBackboard\u201d with a Jacket\n\nA jacket can serve as a **temporary rigid splint** if you have nothing else. The goal is to keep the thoracic spine straight and avoid any flexion, extension, or rotation.\n\n### Materials Needed\n- A long jacket, coat, or even a heavy shirt/blanket if no jacket is available\n- Rope, duct tape, or strong adhesive strips\n- Optional: two rigid items (e.g., a piece of wood, a long stick, or a sturdy cardboard tube) to reinforce the jacket\n\n### Steps\n\n| Step | Action | Tips |\n|------|--------|------|\n| **1** | **Position the person** | Have them lie on a flat, firm surface if possible. If lying is unsafe, keep them sitting with the spine as straight as possible. |\n| **2** | **Place the jacket** | Open the jacket completely. Slide it under the person\u2019s chest, covering the sternum, and wrap it around the lower back. The jacket\u2019s sleeves should be tucked under the arms, and the hood (if any) should be pulled down so it does not lift the head. |\n| **3** | **Secure the jacket** | Use the jacket\u2019s existing straps or tie them with rope or tape. If you\u2019re using rope, tie a secure knot that will hold under weight. If using tape, wrap it around the jacket and the body in a way that holds the jacket in place. |\n| **4** | **Add rigidity (if available)** | Slide a straight, rigid object (e.g., a stick, a board, or a cardboard tube) through the jacket\u2019s open parts to stiffen it. Secure it with tape or rope so it cannot shift. |\n| **5** | **Check alignment** | Gently feel the spine. The back of the jacket should sit flat on the spine with no noticeable bend or gap. Ensure the head is in a neutral position (chin slightly tucked, ears aligned with shoulders). |\n| **6** | **Secure the limbs** | Use additional strips of cloth, bandages, or the jacket\u2019s sleeves to hold arms and legs in a neutral position. Keep the knees slightly bent and feet flat if possible. |\n| **7** | **Re\u2011check** | Re\u2011inspect the entire immobilization after any movement or adjustment. The jacket must remain snug and in the same position. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. While Waiting for EMS\n\n| Action | Reason |\n|--------|--------|\n| **Keep the person still** | Any movement can cause further damage. |\n| **Support the head and neck** | Use a cervical collar if available; if not, keep the head in a neutral position with hands or a rolled towel. |\n| **Avoid bending or twisting** | Do not ask the person to sit or stand. |\n| **Monitor vital signs** | Check breathing, pulse, and consciousness. |\n| **Provide reassurance** | A calm voice reduces stress, which can help keep the spine still. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Do Not Do\n\n| Item | Why |\n|------|-----|\n| **Move the person** (unless absolutely necessary) | Can exacerbate spinal injury. |\n| **Remove the jacket** | It is a temporary splint keeping the spine straight. |\n| **Apply heat or cold to the back** | May interfere with future medical assessment. |\n| **Assume the jacket is a perfect backboard** | It\u2019s a makeshift measure; it may not be rigid enough for heavy lifting. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. After EMS Arrival\n\n- **Hand over the jacket** and explain how you immobilized the patient.  \n- **Follow the EMS crew\u2019s instructions**; they may replace the jacket with a proper spinal board or cervical collar.  \n- **Do not remove the immobilization** until the medical team deems it safe.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\nA long jacket can **temporarily** keep a suspected spinal injury aligned while you wait for professional help.

{"instruction": "How can I safely move myself or someone else to a safer location without aggravating the injury?", "response": "**Emergency spinal\u2011injury protocol (for use only when no professional help is immediately available)**  \n**Important:** If you can reach a phone or any way to call emergency services, do so *first*. This guide is a last\u2011resort measure. Spinal injuries are extremely serious; the safest course is to wait for trained medical personnel.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Assess the situation briefly**\n\n| Question | Why it matters | Action |\n|----------|----------------|--------|\n| **Is the person conscious?** | If unconscious, you have less to work with and the risk of worsening the injury is higher. | Proceed with utmost caution. |\n| **Is the person breathing and pulsing?** | If not, treat as a medical emergency (CPR, etc.). | Call 911 (or local emergency number) immediately. |\n| **Are there obvious deformities or open wounds?** | They may indicate a different type of trauma that needs immediate attention. | Do not touch the area; call emergency services. |\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Keep the spine neutral**\n\n* **Do not rotate** the head or body.  \n* **Keep the head, neck, and torso in a straight line** as much as possible.  \n* If the person is already lying flat, you can use your arms to keep the torso and hips level.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Create a \u201cspine\u2011stable\u201d position**\n\n1. **Hold the back**:  \n   * Place your hands behind the person\u2019s shoulders (if possible).  \n   * Slide one arm under the armpit and the other under the buttocks.  \n   * Pull gently but firmly, keeping the torso straight.  \n2. **Use pillows or rolled towels**:  \n   * Place a rolled towel or a pillow under the neck (if you have to move the head).  \n   * Do *not* tilt the head; just support it lightly.\n\n> **Tip:** If you don\u2019t have a towel, you can use a long piece of fabric (e.g., a blanket). The key is to keep the spine straight, not to stabilize the head separately.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Stabilize the head and neck (if necessary)**\n\n* **If you need to move the person\u2019s head**, use a \u201cchin\u2011to\u2011chest\u201d position:  \n  * Gently tuck the chin to the chest so that the head doesn\u2019t move.  \n  * Avoid lifting or turning the head.  \n* If you have a rigid object (e.g., a cardboard tube or a rolled towel), place it along the spine from the chin to the hips.  \n  * This is a very crude \u201cbackboard\u201d that can help keep the spine aligned during movement.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Move to a safer location**\n\n1. **Choose a short, flat route** (e.g., from the floor to a nearby couch or bed).  \n2. **Walk slowly and in a straight line**.  \n3. **Keep the body upright**:  \n   * If the person is lying, try to keep them lying flat.  \n   * If you must stand them up, do so slowly, keeping the spine straight (think of keeping the shoulders, hips, and knees aligned).  \n4. **Use a \u201cslip\u201d technique**:  \n   * With both of you holding the sides of the torso, move together as a unit, taking small steps.  \n   * Do not turn the body or twist the torso.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **If you need to use a chair or wheelchair**\n\n1. **Place a long, straight object (e.g., a long stick or a broom handle) under the person\u2019s torso** while they are lying down.  \n2. **Secure the object** to both the back of the chair and the person\u2019s chest with a belt, rope, or cloth.  \n3. **Move the chair** slowly, keeping the spine aligned.  \n4. **If the person cannot sit up safely**, keep them on the chair but lying flat until professional help arrives.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **After the move \u2013 stabilize until help arrives**\n\n* **Lay the person flat on a hard surface** (e.g., a mattress or the floor).  \n* **Apply a rigid backboard if available**:  \n  * Slide the person onto the board carefully, keeping the spine straight.  \n  * Secure the person with straps or towels to the board.  \n* **Keep the person lying flat** and avoid unnecessary movement.  \n* **Monitor breathing and consciousness**.  \n* **Call emergency services again if not already done**; provide the exact location and a description of the injury.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **When professional help arrives**\n\n* **Explain everything you did**: how you moved, what you used for stabilization, etc.  \n* **Do not let them out of your sight** if they are not conscious, as they may still be unconscious.\n\n---\n\n## Key Safety Rules\n\n| Rule | Why it matters | How to follow |\n|------|----------------|--------------|\n| **Never rotate the spine** | Rotation can tear spinal cord or ligaments. | Keep head, neck, and torso in a straight line. |\n| **Avoid bending the neck** | Flexion can compress spinal cord. | Keep chin to chest or support with a towel. |\n| **Move slowly** | Sudden movement can worsen injury. | Take small steps, keep torso stable. |\n| **Call emergency services immediately** | Professional care is essential. | Use a phone or shout for help. |\n| **Keep the spine as straight as possible** | The goal is to prevent additional trauma. | Use pillows, rolled towels, or a backboard for support. |\n\n---\n\n### Final Warning\n\nIf at any point you feel the person\u2019s condition worsening (e.g., loss of consciousness, difficulty breathing, or severe pain), stop all movement, try to keep them still, and *call emergency services* or shout for help. **Professional medical treatment is required for spinal injuries.** This guide is only a temporary measure when no other help is available.", "context": "8.

Use a **clean, non\u2011sticking cloth or bandage** to tie the edges loosely around the limb/torso\u2014no pressure directly on the burn.  \n4. **Check the fit**  \n   - The dressing should be **loose enough** so that blood can still circulate underneath.  \n   - It should not be tight enough to cut off circulation or compress the burn.  \n5. **Avoid friction**  \n   - Keep the dressing in place but do not massage or rub the burn area.  \n\n---\n\n## 4. Monitor and care while waiting for help\n\n| Action | How to do it | Why it matters |\n|--------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Keep the dressing moist** | If the dressing dries, lightly spray with cool water every few hours. | Prevents skin from drying and cracking. |\n| **Check for pain** | Severe pain may indicate worsening; keep an eye on swelling or discoloration. | Early signs of complications. |\n| **Avoid hot or cold temperatures** | Keep the injured area away from heat sources and avoid applying ice or hot compresses. | Prevents shock and further tissue damage. |\n| **Do not apply creams, ointments, or butter** | These can trap heat and bacteria. | Can worsen the injury. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. When to seek professional care\n\n- **Large burn (>3\u202finches or covering a major joint)**  \n- **Burn on face, hands, feet, genitals, or over a major joint**  \n- **If you see signs of infection** (increased redness, pus, fever, worsening pain)  \n- **If the dressing becomes soaked or contaminated**  \n\n**Always call emergency services**.

Preparing to Inspect Safely\n\n1. **Create a stable, well\u2011lit area**  \n   - Sit or stand where you can keep your hands steady.  \n   - If you must use a candle, place it on a fire\u2011proof surface (ceramic tile, metal tray) and keep it at least 1\u202fm (3\u202fft) away from the burn and any flammable material.\n\n2. **Use the phone\u2019s flashlight instead of a candle whenever possible**  \n   - A smartphone\u2019s LED emits cool light and does not produce heat or flame.  \n   - If your phone\u2019s flashlight is dim, consider swapping it with a small, battery\u2011powered LED torch that is rated for medical or first\u2011aid use.\n\n3. **Keep a safe distance**  \n   - Hold the light source 20\u201330\u202fcm (8\u201312\u202fin) from the burn\u2014close enough to see details but far enough that the light doesn\u2019t heat the skin.\n\n4. **Avoid direct contact**  \n   - Never press the light source against the burn.  \n   - Avoid shining the light through any dressing that might contain chemicals or dyes that could fluoresce or mislead your assessment.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Inspecting the Burn with a Phone Flashlight\n\n| Step | What to do | Tips |\n|------|------------|------|\n| **1. Open the camera or flashlight app** | Most phones have a built\u2011in flashlight button (usually in the quick\u2011settings panel). | Turn on the flashlight only when ready; dim the phone screen to avoid glare. |\n| **2. Position the phone** | Hold it at arm\u2019s length, perpendicular to the burn, and adjust until you can see the color, texture, and any blisters or tissue changes. | If you can\u2019t see the burn clearly, move to a brighter spot or use a different angle. |\n| **3. Observe color changes** | Second\u2011degree burns may appear red, blistered, or pale; third\u2011degree burns look white, blackened, or charred. | If you notice sudden changes (e.g., increased blistering, spreading redness, or signs of infection like foul odor), call for help immediately. |\n| **4. Take note, not touch** | Jot down or record your observations in a simple note: \u201cSecond\u2011degree burn, deep in the left forearm, blistered, no signs of infection yet.\u201d | Do not apply creams, ointments, or compresses without medical advice. |\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Keep the flame small and far from the burn. | Keep a fire extinguisher or a damp cloth nearby in case of flare\u2011up. |\n| **2. Hold the candle at a safe distance** | Use a stick or a long\u2011handle tool to keep the candle at least 30\u202fcm (12\u202fin) from the burn. | Never let the flame touch skin or clothing. |\n| **3. Shine the light** | Angle the flame so the light falls on the burn. Do not look directly into the flame; instead, observe the light reflection. | If the candle flame flickers or smolders, extinguish immediately. |\n| **4. Check for color and texture** | Look for white/blackened areas (third\u2011degree) or red/blistered regions (second\u2011degree). | If you see smoke or odor, extinguish the candle and get fresh air. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. After Inspection\n\n- **Cover the burn** with a clean, dry dressing (sterile gauze or a clean cloth).  \n- **Keep the person stable**; elevate the burned limb if possible and avoid moving the burned area.  \n- **Monitor for signs of shock**: pale, clammy skin, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, or fainting.  \n- **Wait for emergency responders**; do not drive to a hospital unless it is absolutely necessary and you have no other option.  \n\n---\n\n## 6. Key Takeaways\n\n- **Always seek professional medical help first.**  \n- **Use a phone flashlight over a candle** whenever possible; candles are risky due to flame and heat.  \n- **Maintain a safe distance** and never touch the burn with any light source.  \n- **Keep the burn covered** until a healthcare professional evaluates it.\n\n---\n\n### Final Safety Alert  \nIf the burn is large, involves the face, hands, feet, genitals, or if the individual is unconscious, in shock, or shows signs of severe pain or breathing difficulty, call emergency services right away.

Good options are:\n\n| Substitute | How to use it | Why it works |\n|------------|---------------|--------------|\n| **Clean, dry cotton cloth** (e.g., a handkerchief or clean t\u2011shirt) | Cut into a piece large enough to cover the burn. Lay it gently over the wound, secure with clean, loosely\u2011tied bandage or clean, wide strips of tape (avoid tape that sticks to the burn). | Cotton is soft, absorbs little moisture, and won\u2019t stick or tug when removed. |\n| **Clean paper towels** (not creped, thick\u2011pulp type) | Lay one or two sheets over the burn. Secure with a non\u2011adhesive bandage or loose tape. | Paper towels are readily available, inexpensive, and won\u2019t carry skin bacteria. |\n| **Clean, dry plastic wrap** (e.g., food\u2011grade cling film) | Cover the burn with a sheet of plastic wrap, then loosely tape the edges to a clean cloth or use a clean bandage. | Plastic wrap creates a barrier against air and contaminants while still allowing a slight \u201cbreathing\u201d surface. |\n| **Clean, dry gauze pads from a wound kit or surgical glove** | If you have a surgical glove or a clean, unused gauze pad (even a paper\u2011cutting pad can work if it\u2019s clean), use it as you would normal gauze. | These materials are designed for wound contact and are less likely to cause irritation. |\n| **A clean, damp cloth** (if you can\u2019t get dry materials) | Lightly dampen a clean cloth with sterile or boiled water, pat dry, then lay over the burn. | Moisture helps soothe the skin, but the cloth must be free of dirt or debris. |\n\n---\n\n### Step\u2011by\u2011step care for a severe (2\u00b0\u20113\u00b0) burn **without sterile gauze**\n\n1. **Call emergency services immediately.**  \n   Severe burns are a medical emergency; professional care is essential. While you wait, follow the steps below.\n\n2. **Cool the burn.**  \n   * Hold the burned area under cool (not cold) running water for 10\u201315\u202fminutes.  \n   * If running water isn\u2019t available, immerse the burn in a container of cool water or use a clean, cool cloth.  \n   * Do **not** use ice or very cold packs \u2013 they can worsen tissue damage.\n\n3. **Remove obvious contaminants.**  \n   * If the burn is from a chemical, gently rinse with water for several minutes.  \n   * Never use alcohol or any irritating solutions.\n\n4. **Cover the burn.**  \n   * Choose one of the clean substitutes listed above.  \n   * Gently lay the material over the entire wound.  \n   * Secure it with a clean, loose bandage or wide tape strips.  \n   * Do **not** use adhesive tape that will stick directly to the burn or apply ointments, butter, toothpaste, or other household creams \u2013 these can trap heat and increase infection risk.\n\n5. **Keep the burn dry and protected.**  \n   * Change the dressing only if it becomes wet, soiled, or starts to loosen.  \n   * If you must change it, wash your hands (or use an alcohol wipe) before touching the burn.\n\n6. **Monitor for signs of infection or shock.**  \n   * Redness spreading, pus, fever, chills, or rapid heartbeat are red flags.  \n   * If any of these occur, seek medical help immediately.\n\n7. **Keep the patient warm and calm.**  \n   * Use blankets or extra clothing to prevent hypothermia, especially for third\u2011degree burns that affect large areas.  \n   * Avoid giving oral fluids to a conscious patient with severe burns \u2013 swallowing can be painful, and aspiration risk increases.\n\n---\n\n### When you *must* use a more improvisational dressing\n\nIf you\u2019re in a remote location or lack any of the above options, you can still use **clean, breathable cloth or paper**. The key is to:\n\n- **Avoid rough, abrasive, or dirty materials** (e.g., unwashed rags, dirty towels).  \n- **Ensure the dressing doesn\u2019t stick** \u2013 loose tape or a clean cloth that doesn\u2019t adhere directly to the wound is best.  \n- **Keep the dressing as flat and snug as possible** without constricting circulation.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n- **Sterile gauze is ideal, but clean, non\u2011adhesive materials like cotton cloth, paper towels, or plastic wrap are acceptable temporary substitutes for covering a severe burn.**  \n- **Treat the burn with cool water, cover it with a clean dressing, keep it dry, and seek professional medical care as soon as possible.**  \n\nIf the burn covers a large area, involves the face, hands, feet, or genitals, or the patient shows any sign of shock, **do not wait**\u2014call emergency services immediately.", "context": "9.

Keep the mother **stable** (lateral or knees\u2011to\u2011chest position).<br>2. **Do NOT** push on the baby. Instead, gently **lift** or **pull** the breech part upward toward the abdomen while supporting the baby\u2019s head.<br>3. If you can, try a **manual external cephalic version**: apply firm pressure to the upper abdomen and gently rotate the baby to bring the head into the birth canal. | \u2022\u202fA breech baby can get trapped in the birth canal if the head is not brought in.<br>\u2022\u202fManual rotation keeps the baby\u2019s head in the safest position for delivery. |\n| **Shoulder (or transverse) presentation** | \u2022\u202fYou feel a **shoulder** (broad, rounded shoulder blade) between the cervix and the pelvic inlet.<br>\u2022\u202fThe baby\u2019s head is **not palpable** inside the abdomen.<br>\u2022\u202fFetal heart is usually heard near the **upper abdomen** (near the ribs). | 1. **Do NOT** push on the shoulder; this can cause shoulder dystocia. <br>2. Perform the **McRoberts maneuver**: flex the mother\u2019s knees and thighs toward her chest to widen the pelvis.<br>3. Apply **suprapubic pressure** (directly over the baby\u2019s abdomen) to help free the shoulder.<br>4. If you have a **clean, long, sturdy stick or a rolled blanket**, use it as a lever to gently lift the shoulder into the pelvis. | \u2022\u202fShoulder dystocia can cause life\u2011threatening fetal hypoxia and maternal shoulder injury.<br>\u2022\u202fThe McRoberts + suprapubic pressure often releases the trapped shoulder. |\n\n---\n\n## Step\u2011by\u2011step plan for an **emergency breech or shoulder delivery** in a remote setting\n\n> **NOTE**: This guidance is for an *immediate emergency* when you have *no access to obstetric care*.  \n>  **If a safe way to transport the mother to a hospital is possible, do so immediately**.  \n>  If you are unsure about any step, **ask for help** from any available trained professional (e.g., a midwife, nurse, or doctor) or a local community health worker.\n\n### 1. Stabilize the mother\n\n| Task | Practical tip |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Position** | \u2022\u202fPlace her on her **left side** (or knees\u2011to\u2011chest) to relieve uterine pressure on the vena cava. <br>\u2022\u202fIf she\u2019s unstable, have her lie flat on her back (short\u2011term) and then move her to the side as soon as possible. |\n| **Hydration** | \u2022\u202fGive her clear fluids (water, electrolyte drink) if possible. Avoid sugary drinks that may cause dehydration. |\n| **Monitor** | \u2022\u202fCheck pulse, breathing, and consciousness. If you can, palpate the fetal heart rate in the abdomen (use a stethoscope if available). <br>\u2022\u202fIf fetal heart rate >140\u202fbpm and the mother\u2019s contractions are strong, the baby may be in distress. |\n\n### 2. Identify the presentation (breech vs. shoulder)\n\n| Cue | How to test |\n|-----|-------------|\n| **Buttocks or feet first (breech)** | \u2022\u202fUse your hands to feel the upper belly. If you feel a rounded shape that resembles a baby\u2019s buttock or feet, you\u2019re likely dealing with breech. <br>\u2022\u202fCheck where the fetal heart can be heard (lower vs. upper abdomen). |\n| **Shoulder/arm first (shoulder presentation)** | \u2022\u202fLook for a prominent shoulder shape in the upper abdomen or between the uterus and cervix. <br>\u2022\u202fYou will not feel the baby\u2019s head in the abdomen. |\n\n### 3. For a **breech** delivery\n\n| Action | What to do | Safety tip |\n|--------|------------|------------|\n| **Gentle upward traction** | \u2022\u202fUsing a clean, sturdy cloth or a rolled blanket, wrap it around the breech portion. <br>\u2022\u202fPull the breech upward (toward the abdomen) while gently pushing on the baby\u2019s head toward the cervix. Keep the head supported. | Never pull on the baby\u2019s head alone; it can cause lacerations or death. |\n| **Manual external cephalic version (if you\u2019re trained)** | \u2022\u202fPlace your fingers just above the pubic symphysis. Apply firm pressure to the upper abdomen while rotating the baby so the head can enter the pelvis. <br>\u2022\u202fDo this only if the baby\u2019s head is not yet inside the birth canal. | This is **advanced**. If you\u2019re not comfortable, skip it and proceed with traction. |\n| **Push gently only after the head is in** | \u2022\u202fOnce the baby\u2019s head has entered the pelvis (you\u2019ll feel a \u201cpopping\u201d sensation), you can use gentle pushes to complete delivery. | Avoid strong pushes; they can cause shoulder dystocia in breech cases. |\n\n### 4. For a **shoulder** or **transverse** presentation\n\n| Action | What to do | Safety tip |\n|--------|------------|------------|\n| **McRoberts maneuver** | \u2022\u202fHave the mother flex her knees and thighs toward her chest. <br>\u2022\u202fIf she\u2019s lying down, bend her knees and pull them in toward her chest. | This widens the pelvis and may free the shoulder. |\n| **Suprapubic pressure** | \u2022\u202fPlace your palm just above the pubic bone (over the baby\u2019s abdomen). Apply firm, steady pressure. <br>\u2022\u202fIf you have a clean stick or rolled blanket, use it as a lever to lift the shoulder into the pelvis. | Do not apply pressure too far back; it may injure the uterus or placenta. |\n| **Manual rotation** (if skilled and necessary) | \u2022\u202fWith both hands on the shoulder, try to rotate it so the arm moves under the baby's pelvis. | Use this only if you\u2019re comfortable and if it\u2019s safe; otherwise, move to emergency transport. |\n\n### 5. Preparing for the newborn\n\n| Task | What to do | Safety tip |\n|------|------------|------------|\n| **Keep the baby warm** | \u2022\u202fWrap the newborn in a clean cloth, blankets, or your own clothing. <br>\u2022\u202fIf possible, place the baby on your chest for skin\u2011to\u2011skin contact. | Newborns lose heat quickly. |\n| **Clear airway** | \u2022\u202fIf you can\u2019t see a clear airway, gently tilt the baby\u2019s head back and look for a mouth opening. Use a clean cloth to clear any visible mucus. | Avoid choking; keep the baby\u2019s airway open. |\n| **Check breathing and pulse** | \u2022\u202fIf you have a stethoscope, listen to the baby\u2019s heart. <br>\u2022\u202fIf you can\u2019t, feel for a pulse at the carotid or femoral area. | Newborns may be very fast and weak; a quick check can guide you. |\n\n### 6. After delivery\n\n| Action | What to do | Safety tip |\n|--------|------------|------------|\n| **Clean and dry** | \u2022\u202fGently wipe the baby with a clean cloth; do not use soap or water. <br>\u2022\u202fPlace the baby on a warm surface. | Avoid hypothermia. |\n| **Monitor mother** | \u2022\u202fCheck for excessive bleeding, signs of infection, or shock. <br>\u2022\u202fIf you notice any of these, seek medical help immediately. | Post\u2011partum hemorrhage is common; keep an eye on bleeding. |\n| **Plan for transport** | \u2022\u202fArrange safe transport to the nearest medical facility as soon as possible. | The sooner you get professional help, the safer for both mother and baby. |\n\n---\n\n## What to do **if you\u2019re unsure** or if the situation gets worse\n\n1. **Call for help** \u2013 If you have a phone, call local emergency services or a community health worker.  \n2. **Stop any unsafe maneuvers** \u2013 If you\u2019re not certain about a technique (e.g., manual rotation), stop and wait for professional assistance.  \n3. **Do not use forceps or vacuum** \u2013 These tools are not typically available in remote settings and can cause serious injury if used incorrectly.  \n4. **If the baby is not delivered within ~30 minutes** \u2013 Arrange the safest possible transportation immediately; do not keep waiting if resources are lacking.\n\n---\n\n### Final safety reminder\n\n- **Only perform procedures you are trained for**; do not try advanced obstetric techniques unless you\u2019re confident.  \n- **Seek professional medical care immediately**.  \n- **Always keep the mother and baby\u2019s airway open** and monitor vital signs.  \n\nBy focusing on stabilization, identifying the presentation, and using the appropriate gentle maneuvers listed above, you maximize the chances of a safe delivery even in a remote, resource\u2011limited environment.

They\u2019re meant for a skilled, calm provider who can feel what\u2019s happening inside the birth canal.  If at any point you\u2019re unsure or feel the baby\u2019s life is at risk, **call for help immediately** (fire, ambulance, or a nearby hospital if reachable).\n\n---\n\n## 1. Confirm the problem is a shoulder dystocia\n\n| Check | Why it matters |\n|-------|----------------|\n| **Baby\u2019s head is visible (or palpable) but the baby has not emerged, and the pushing stops** | Indicates that the shoulder has jammed. |\n| **Fetal heart rate (if you have a monitor) or visible fetal pulse** | Confirms that the baby is still alive. |\n| **If you feel a \u201chard\u201d feeling behind the mother\u2019s belly** | Suggests the shoulder is impacted. |\n\nIf you\u2019re uncertain, the safest assumption is that the shoulder is stuck and you should proceed to the next steps.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Keep calm and don\u2019t panic\n\n- **Breathe slowly** \u2013 a calm voice and steady hands help the mother push more effectively.\n- **Assure the mother** \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re going to get this baby out together. Stay with me.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## 3. Apply the McRoberts maneuver\n\n**Goal:** Reduce the angle between the uterus and the pelvis to free the shoulder.\n\n| Step | How to do it |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Position** | While the baby\u2019s head is in the birth canal, bring the mother\u2019s legs straight out to the sides and lift them up as high as possible (as if she\u2019s doing a \u201cS\u2011pike\u201d). |\n| **Hold** | Keep the legs in that position for **30\u201360\u202fseconds**. |\n| **Why it helps** | The high, wide position opens the pelvis and pushes the baby\u2019s shoulder up toward the uterine wall, often freeing it. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Suprapubic pressure (aka \u201cPelvic pressure\u201d)\n\n**Goal:** Push the baby\u2019s shoulder forward into the pelvic cavity, freeing the head.\n\n| Step | How to do it |\n|------|--------------|\n| **Locate the area** | Just above the pubic bone, just below the belly button, where the pelvic brim is palpable. |\n| **Apply firm, steady pressure** | Push downward and slightly forward, as if you\u2019re gently \u201cpushing the shoulder out.\u201d |\n| **Duration** | Keep the pressure for **30\u201360\u202fseconds** while the mother continues pushing (if she\u2019s able). |\n| **If it doesn\u2019t work** | Continue for several attempts, but be mindful of the mother\u2019s pain and fatigue. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Rotational maneuvers (for more advanced providers)\n\nThese are more complex and should only be attempted by someone with obstetric training. If you have the knowledge, consider:\n\n- **McRoberts + Suprapubic pressure + Rotational \u201cMiller\u201d or \u201cWoods\u201d maneuver** \u2013 rotating the baby\u2019s shoulder laterally to ease the lock.\n\n**Caution:** Improper rotation can cause injury to the baby or mother. Only use if you\u2019re comfortable and can feel the baby\u2019s shoulder.\n\n---\n\n## 6. If the above fails\n\n| Action | Why it\u2019s needed |\n|--------|-----------------|\n| **Call emergency services (or arrange rapid transport)** | Professional obstetric help (or a neonatal intensive care unit) is essential if you\u2019re unable to deliver. |\n| **Keep the mother upright if possible** | Gravity assists in completing the delivery. |\n| **Continue gentle, paced maternal pushing** | Even if the baby isn\u2019t coming out, maternal pushing can help maintain fetal oxygenation. |\n| **Do not force the baby out by hand or attempt to pull the head** \u2013 that can cause brain injury. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. After delivery\n\n1. **Clear the airway** \u2013 suction any fluids (but do not intubate unless trained).\n2. **Check breathing** \u2013 if the baby isn\u2019t breathing, start gentle stimulation or rescue breathing (if you know how).\n3. **Place the baby on the mother\u2019s chest or abdomen** for skin\u2011to\u2011skin contact if possible.\n4. **Stabilize the baby** \u2013 keep warm, monitor heart rate, and wait for professional medical support.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Summary (Checklist)\n\n- [ ] Confirm shoulder dystocia.\n- [ ] Keep calm and reassure mother.\n- [ ] McRoberts maneuver (leg lift).\n- [ ] Suprapubic pressure (direct pelvic pressure).\n- [ ] If you\u2019re trained, attempt a safe rotational maneuver.\n- [ ] If none of the above works, call for help and keep the mother upright and pushing gently.\n- [ ] After delivery, clear airway and stabilize baby.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Safety Note**\n\n- **Do not use instruments (forceps, vacuum extractor) unless you have formal training and the necessary equipment.** Improper use can cause severe injury.\n- **If the baby\u2019s heart rate drops or you feel the baby\u2019s head is \u201ccoming out\u201d but the shoulder is still stuck, immediately seek professional help.**\n\n---\n\n**If you\u2019re alone and no emergency service is reachable, keep the mother calm, continue the McRoberts maneuver + suprapubic pressure, and try to get the baby\u2019s head out first.** Once the head emerges, the baby usually follows.\n\nIf you\u2019re able, record the situation (e.g., via a video call to a medical hotline) so that professionals can guide you in real time.

Call for emergency help immediately\n1. **Dial the local emergency number** (911 in the U.S., 999 in the U.K., 112 in the EU, etc.).  \n2. **Tell the dispatcher**:  \n   - \u201cI have diabetes.\u201d  \n   - \u201cI\u2019m having severe low blood sugar/high blood sugar symptoms that are not improving.\u201d  \n   - \u201cI\u2019m alone, and I\u2019m experiencing confusion, sweating, weakness, or other worsening signs.\u201d  \n   - \u201cI don\u2019t have my blood\u2011glucose meter, but I can describe my symptoms.\u201d  \n\n> **Why?**  Emergency responders can bring advanced glucose\u2011replacement supplies (IV fluids, glucagon) and treat complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hypoglycemic seizures.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Stay in a safe position\n- **If you feel light\u2011headed, dizzy, or confused:**  \n  - Sit down or lie flat.  \n  - Keep your head above your heart to help blood flow to the brain.  \n  - If you feel faint or have a seizure\u2011like episode, **do not** try to stand or drive.  \n- **If you are already unconscious or cannot stay awake**:  \n  - Call 911 (or the local emergency number) **without delay**.  \n  - If you have a phone, ask a neighbor or a passerby for help if you can\u2019t reach emergency services yourself.\n\n---\n\n## 3. If you have a glucagon emergency kit (or a glucagon autoinjector) \u2013 use it now\n- **Hypoglycemia only**: Glucagon can raise your blood sugar when you cannot swallow.  \n- **Follow the kit\u2019s instructions** (usually, pinch your thigh, inject the solution, then give yourself a sugary drink if you can).  \n\n> **If you\u2019re not sure how to use it** or don\u2019t have a kit, skip to the next step and let emergency responders know you need glucagon.\n\n---\n\n## 4.

{"instruction": "Which household items can I use as a rigid splint if I have no commercial splint available?", "response": "### Quick Answer  \nIf you have no commercial splint, use any **stiff, rigid item** that can be wrapped securely around the injured limb and will stay in place while you transport or rest. Common household choices include:\n\n| Household Item | Why it works | How to use it |\n|-----------------|--------------|---------------|\n| **Stiff cardboard** (newspaper, cereal box, or thick cardboard strip) | Flat, rigid, and easy to cut | Cut to fit the limb, wrap in a cloth or bandage on both sides, and secure with tape or a tight elastic band. |\n| **Wooden stick / dowel / ruler** | Straight, sturdy, can be trimmed to length | Place parallel to the limb, wrap with a cloth or elastic, then secure. |\n| **Hard plastic bottle or milk jug (empty)** | Rigid and slightly curved for comfort | Cut the top off, wrap inside the limb, and secure. |\n| **Book / paperback** (or stack of books) | Flat and firm | Lay across the limb, then wrap and secure. |\n| **Stiff plastic bag (e.g., dry\u2011cleaning bag)** | Flat and stiff when folded | Fold into a rigid shape, place over the injury, wrap and secure. |\n| **Bicycle handlebar or metal rod** | Strong, narrow | Use as a splint if you can safely wrap it in a cloth and secure. |\n| **Stiff towel or scarf (folded many times)** | Becomes rigid when compressed | Fold to desired thickness, wrap around limb, secure. |\n\n> **Tip:** The goal is to **immobilize** the joint and prevent movement of the bone. The splint should be long enough to extend **at least 2\u20133 inches** beyond the ends of the fracture on both sides.\n\n---\n\n## Step\u2011by\u2011Step Guide to Create a Makeshift Splint\n\n1. **Assess the Injury (If Possible)**\n   - Look for obvious deformity, swelling, or discolored skin.\n   - Try to move the limb gently; if it hurts more, avoid moving it at all.\n   - If you see a dislocation (joint out of place) or suspect a severe fracture, **do not** attempt to realign. Move the person slowly to a safe position and keep the limb still.\n\n2. **Gather Materials**\n   - **Rigid base**: one of the items above (cardboard, wood, plastic, etc.).\n   - **Padding**: a clean cloth, towel, gauze, or even a folded newspaper.\n   - **Securement**: elastic bandage, duct tape, strips of cloth, or a strap.\n\n3. **Prepare the Rigid Base**\n   - Cut or trim it to fit the injured portion.\n   - For cardboard: fold it into a \u201cC\u201d shape if you need a curved splint (helps when immobilizing a finger or ankle).\n   - For a bottle: cut off the top and trim to the right length.\n\n4. **Add Padding**\n   - Place the padded material on the side of the splint that contacts the skin. This prevents pressure sores and protects against heat from the splint.\n   - If the injury is in a joint (e.g., wrist or ankle), put padding under the splint and also around the joint to cushion it.\n\n5. **Position the Splint**\n   - Lay the rigid base **parallel** to the bone or along the natural curve of the limb. For finger fractures, the splint should lie on the side of the finger and extend past the joints above and below the injury.\n   - Keep the joint at a neutral position (not hyper\u2011extended or flexed).\n\n6. **Secure the Splint**\n   - Wrap an elastic bandage or cloth strap around the limb, starting above the splint and moving downwards. Tighten enough to hold the splint firmly but not so tight that circulation is compromised.\n   - If you\u2019re using duct tape or another rigid tape, wrap it snugly around the splint and the limb to hold everything in place.\n\n7. **Check for Circulation**\n   - Look for color change, swelling, or numbness distal (further from the heart) to the injury.\n   - If the limb turns pale, bluish, or feels cold, loosen the bandage slightly to improve blood flow.\n\n8. **Limit Movement**\n   - Instruct the person not to move the limb. Even small movements can worsen a fracture.\n\n9. **Transport and Medical Care**\n   - Move the injured person slowly to a safe area (avoid sudden twists).\n   - **Seek professional medical help as soon as possible**. Even if you suspect a simple break, a medical professional must confirm the injury, clean the wound if needed, and provide proper immobilization and treatment.\n\n---\n\n## Safety & When to Seek Help\n\n| Situation | Why it\u2019s a Concern | Immediate Action |\n|-----------|-------------------|------------------|\n| **Severe pain or swelling** | Could indicate a displaced fracture or severe injury. | Stop moving, apply the splint, get medical help ASAP. |\n| **Skin is broken or bleeding** | Risk of infection and blood loss. | Clean the wound gently, apply pressure, splint, seek care. |\n| **Dislocation** (joint out of place, abnormal angle) | Misalignment can damage nerves or blood vessels. | Do **not** try to straighten; keep the joint still, splint, and seek help immediately. |\n| **Numbness, tingling, or loss of pulse** | Possible nerve or vascular injury. | Call emergency services (if available) or move to a safe area, keep the limb elevated if possible. |\n\n**Important:**  \n- A makeshift splint is **only an interim measure**.

The following steps are for non\u2011spinal injuries or when professional help isn\u2019t immediately available.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Ensure Your Own Safety First**\n- **Protect yourself** from potential hazards (traffic, unstable structures, etc.).\n- Use gloves if available (even a kitchen glove can reduce contamination).\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Check the Person\u2019s Condition (ABCs)**\n| Step | What to Do | Why It Matters |\n|------|------------|----------------|\n| **A \u2013 Airway** | Make sure the airway is clear. | If the person is unconscious, reposition them on their side. |\n| **B \u2013 Breathing** | Look, listen, and feel for breathing. | If not breathing, begin rescue breathing or CPR. |\n| **C \u2013 Circulation** | Check pulse and look for major bleeding. | Control bleeding with direct pressure or a clean cloth. |\n\n*If the person is not breathing or has no pulse, start CPR and call emergency services immediately.*\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Prevent Further Injury**\n1. **Do Not Move the Limb** \u2013 Keep the affected arm/leg in the position you found it.\n2. **Limit Movement of the Whole Body** \u2013 Encourage the person to lie still. If you suspect a neck or back injury, do **not** move the head, neck, or torso.\n3. **Avoid Touching the Injured Area** \u2013 Hands can apply unintended pressure.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Stabilize the Injured Limb**\n\n#### A. **Position the Limb**\n- Gently bring the limb to a comfortable position, ideally slightly elevated if possible.\n- Place a clean, soft pad or a folded blanket under the injured area for cushioning.\n\n#### B. **Create a Makeshift Splint**\nYou\u2019ll need:\n- **Rigid material** (e.g., a firm cardboard box, a stick, a broken piece of a plastic bottle, a ruler, a wooden stick).\n- **Padding** (towels, clothing, a blanket, or a clean cloth).\n- **Taping or Bandaging** (duct tape, surgical tape, cloth strips, or even strips of clothing).\n- **Straps or ties** (string, elastic band, or a piece of sturdy fabric).\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step:**\n\n1. **Lay the Rigid Material** along the length of the limb, from the wrist/ankle up to the elbow/knee.  \n2. **Wrap Padding** loosely over the splint and around the limb, ensuring it covers the injured area without compressing the joint.  \n3. **Secure the Splint**:  \n   - *Taping:* Tape the splint in overlapping strips, ensuring it\u2019s snug but not tight enough to cut off circulation.  \n   - *Straps/Ties:* Loop a strap over the limb and the splint, then tie it securely. If you\u2019re using clothing strips, tie them in a \u201cdouble\u2011knot\u201d or use a rubber band to hold them in place.  \n4. **Check Circulation**: After securing, test the extremity. Look for color change or coolness at the fingertips/toes, and feel for a pulse. If the area becomes pale or very cold, loosen the splint slightly.\n\n#### C. **Stabilize the Joint (If Dislocated)**\n- If the joint is visibly out of place and can be gently moved back without causing severe pain, you may attempt **manual reduction**:\n  1. **Support the limb** with your hands on the bones above and below the joint.  \n  2. **Gently manipulate** the joint back into place, maintaining a steady, controlled motion.  \n  3. **Re\u2011apply the splint** immediately after reduction.\n\n*Note:* Dislocated joints can be very painful and complex; if you\u2019re unsure, leave it to professionals.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Pain Management & Comfort**\n- **Elevate** the injured limb if it\u2019s a fracture and you can do so without moving the person\u2019s body.  \n- **Apply a cold pack** (ice wrapped in a cloth) if available to reduce swelling\u2014don\u2019t apply ice directly to skin.  \n- **Give reassurance** and keep the person calm.  \n- **If pain is severe**, consider giving an over\u2011the\u2011counter pain reliever (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) if the person has no known allergies or contraindications.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Wait for Professional Help**\n- **Stay with the person** until help arrives.  \n- **Keep them still** and monitor for changes: increased pain, worsening swelling, numbness, or loss of sensation.  \n- **If they become unconscious or their condition worsens**, shift to the ABCs again and provide CPR if needed.\n\n---\n\n#### Quick Summary of \u201cFirst Things\u201d\n1. **Stop the flow of damage**: No movement of limb or body.  \n2. **Check ABCs**: Airway, Breathing, Circulation.  \n3. **Create a simple splint** using rigid material + padding + secure fastening.  \n4. **Check circulation** and comfort.  \n5. **Stay with them** and await professionals.\n\n---\n\n**Safety Warning:**  \n- **Never attempt to \u201cre\u2011reduce\u201d a dislocated joint** if you\u2019re not trained\u2014incorrect manipulation can worsen the injury.  \n- **Do not move the person** if you suspect a spinal or neck injury.  \n- **Call emergency services** as soon as it\u2019s safe to do so.\n\nIf at any point you feel the situation is beyond your control or the person\u2019s life is at risk, prioritize calling emergency services and following their on\u2011scene instructions.", "context": "12.

If the person is in danger (e.g., near traffic, a fire), call for emergency help first.\n\n2. **Explain What You\u2019re Doing**  \n   * Tell the injured person: \u201cI\u2019m going to keep this limb still so we can help it heal. Please try to stay as still as possible.\u201d\n\n3. **Choose a Comfortable Posture**  \n   - **Upper limb (arm)**  \n     * Let the arm rest on a pillow or the back of a chair.  \n     * If it\u2019s a shoulder or elbow injury, keep the elbow slightly flexed at a comfortable angle (\u224830\u00b0).  \n   - **Lower limb (leg)**  \n     * If the leg is broken, lie the person on their back and let the leg rest on a pillow.  \n     * For a foot injury, keep the foot slightly above heart level if possible.\n\n4. **Avoid Weight Bearing**  \n   * If it\u2019s a lower limb injury, do **not** let the person put weight on the foot/leg.  \n   * If it\u2019s an upper limb, do not let them use the arm for support (e.g., holding a bag).\n\n5. **Stabilize the Joint (If You Must Move It Slightly)**  \n   * If the limb is in an awkward position (e.g., a hand hanging down), gently **realign** it to a neutral position (no rotation, no extension) while **minimizing movement**.  \n   * Use a firm, non\u2011elastic strap (like a scarf) to hold it in place, but keep it loose enough not to cut off circulation.\n\n6. **Create a Makeshift Splint**  \n   * **Materials**: Stiff cardboard, book, long stick, or folded jacket.  \n   * **Shape**: Follow the natural curvature of the limb.  \n   * **Secure**: Wrap a soft bandage (bandage, scarf, cloth) around the splint and limb, but leave a small gap at the joint to avoid constriction.\n\n7. **Check Circulation**  \n   * After the splint is on, check the skin color, temperature, and pulse at the opposite end of the limb.  \n   * If the limb feels cold or numb, loosen the splint slightly and re\u2011check.\n\n8. **Stay Calm and Monitor**  \n   * Keep the person quiet and still.  \n   * Re\u2011check pain and circulation every 15\u201120 minutes until help arrives.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Tips\n\n- **Never try to \"put it back in place\"** if you suspect a dislocation. That can cause severe damage.\n- **Keep the limb elevated** if possible\u2014gravity helps reduce swelling.\n- **Use soft materials** (towels, cloth) to cushion the splint against the skin.\n- **Avoid over\u2011tightening** the strap or bandage; you want immobilization, not restriction of blood flow.\n\n---\n\n### When to Call for Professional Help\n\n- If the limb is **very swollen, discolored, or numb**.  \n- If the person\u2019s pain is **severe or worsening**.  \n- If you see **signs of a serious internal injury** (e.g., severe deformity, obvious bone protrusion).  \n- If the injury is in a **critical area** (e.g., head, neck, chest, pelvis).\n\nEven if you feel you can manage, professional medical care is always recommended for fractures or dislocations.

Avoid putting ice or very cold packs directly on the skin for long periods. |\n| **Using too little or too much fluid** | <ul><li>Too little fluid: Doesn\u2019t replace lost electrolytes, leading to worsening dehydration, low blood pressure, or kidney damage.</li><li>Too much fluid: Especially cold or sugary drinks, can overload the kidneys, dilute electrolytes, or worsen the heat strain.</li></ul> | Aim for 200\u2013400\u202fml (\u2248\u202f7\u201313\u202foz) every 15\u201320\u202fmin. Use oral rehydration solutions (ORS), coconut water, or diluted sports drinks with electrolytes. Avoid alcohol or caffeinated beverages. |\n| **Ignoring electrolytes** | Dehydration often comes with electrolyte loss (sodium, potassium, chloride). Replacing only water can dilute these electrolytes, leading to muscle cramps, weakness, or cardiac issues. | Add a pinch of sea salt or use ORS packets. A sports drink that contains electrolytes can help, but avoid high\u2011sugar formulas if you\u2019re in a heat\u2011stroke situation. |\n| **Not monitoring core temperature** | If you cool too fast or too slowly, you can miss the point where cooling is needed or overshoot it. | If you have a thermometer, check every 30\u202fmin. Look for signs: rapid heartbeat, confusion, loss of consciousness, or severe dizziness. If no thermometer, rely on symptoms (sharp sweating, red skin, rapid breathing). |\n| **Relying on fans alone when sweating is stopped** | Fans help evaporative cooling only if there\u2019s moisture to evaporate.

Immediate After\u2011Care\n\n| What to do | Why |\n|------------|-----|\n| **Stay with the child** | Watch for signs of distress: difficulty breathing, drooling, abdominal pain, or changes in consciousness. |\n| **Keep them hydrated** | Once you\u2019re in the hospital, they may receive IV fluids. But do **not** give fluids before professional assessment. |\n| **Document what happened** | Note the time of ingestion, the substance name (if known), the amount, and any symptoms you observed. This information will help emergency responders. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. What to Expect at the Hospital\n\n| Typical interventions | What it means |\n|------------------------|---------------|\n| **Decontamination (IV fluids, activated charcoal, or specific antidotes)** | The medical team will neutralize or bind the poison. |\n| **Endoscopy or imaging** | To assess damage to the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. |\n| **Supportive care (ventilation, pain control)** | If the child\u2019s airway or breathing is compromised. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. When to Call 911 vs. \u201cHome\u201d Care\n\n- **Call 911** if the child is:\n  - Unconscious or semi\u2011conscious\n  - Having trouble breathing or choking\n  - Vomiting frequently or showing severe pain\n  - Unable to keep the mouth closed\n\n- **If the child is mild\u2011symptom and stable**, you may:\n  - Keep them hydrated (if they can swallow)\n  - Continue external decontamination\n  - Call 911 after the initial rinse if still uncertain\n\n> **Rule of thumb:** If you doubt anything, call emergency services. It\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Safety and Preventive Tips for the Future\n\n| Practice | Benefit |\n|----------|---------|\n| **Store all corrosive cleaners in locked cabinets or high shelves** | Prevents accidental access. |\n| **Use child\u2011proof containers** | Reduces the chance of ingestion. |\n| **Educate family members** | Everyone should know the risks and immediate actions. |\n| **Keep a well\u2011marked \u201cEmergency Contact\u201d list** | In case poison\u2011control or local hospital is needed. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\n1. **Call emergency services immediately** (911).  \n2. **Remove contaminated clothing** and rinse skin, eyes, and mouth with plenty of water.  \n3. **Do not induce vomiting** or give anything else.  \n4. **Monitor breathing and be ready for rescue breathing/CPR**.  \n5. **Stay with the child** until help arrives.  \n\nThese steps are the safest, most effective way to reduce tissue damage and get the child the professional care they need.

Clean the wound** | \u2022 Rinse gently with clean, lukewarm water or saline.<br>\u2022 Use a mild soap around the area (avoid putting soap directly in the wound). | Don\u2019t use alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine\u2014they can damage tissue and delay healing. | If you see large amounts of pus or the wound looks extremely dirty. |\n| **3. Disinfect (if you have a safe option)** | \u2022 Use 0.05\u202f% chlorhexidine solution or povidone\u2011iodine diluted 1:10 with water.<br>\u2022 Gently apply with a sterile gauze. | If you only have an alcohol wipe, use it sparingly. | If you have no disinfectant, simply rinse and keep clean. |\n| **4. Apply antibiotic ointment** | If available, use a thin layer of bacitracin, neomycin, or mupirocin. | Do **not** over\u2011apply; just a coat to keep the wound moist. | If the ointment is not available, keep the wound covered with a sterile dressing. |\n| **5. Dress the wound** | \u2022 Use a sterile non\u2011adherent pad.<br>\u2022 Cover with an elastic bandage or gauze. | Keep the dressing snug but not tight; replace it if it becomes wet or dirty. | If the dressing is too tight or you see swelling around the wound. |\n| **6.

Use a dental\u2011glue or temporary filling material (e.g., dental wax, clove oil) if you have it. |\n| **Pain that intensifies at the back of the tooth** (root area) and radiates into the jaw or ear | Could be a **fracture** that extends into the root or **deep decay**. | Same cold pack and over\u2011the\u2011counter pain relievers (acetaminophen or ibuprofen). Avoid chewing on that side. |\n| **Sharp, shooting pain when you touch the tooth with a tongue or finger** | Indicates a **tooth fracture** or a **cracked tooth** that\u2019s exposed to air. | Do not bite hard. Keep the area clean; use a mouthwash that contains chlorhexidine or a salt\u2011water rinse. |\n| **Swelling, redness, or pus around the gum** | Signals a **secondary infection** (abscess) that has spread to the gums. | **Seek urgent help**. If a dentist isn\u2019t available, go to the nearest urgent care or emergency department. |\n| **Persistent, throbbing pain that doesn\u2019t subside with OTC medication** | Likely a **deep infection** (pulpitis or abscess). | Same urgent care advice. In the meantime, use cold compresses and avoid hot/cold foods. |\n| **Pain when you swallow or when you swallow a warm or cold drink** | Suggests an infection that\u2019s affecting the nerve or that the cavity has progressed to the pulp. | Call emergency services if pain is intense or if you have trouble breathing or swallowing. |\n| **Foul taste or bad breath** | Often a sign of a dental abscess or decay that has started to break down. | Same as above\u2014seek urgent care. |\n| **No obvious pain but the tooth feels loose** | Possible fracture that has spread to the root or bone loss. | Avoid chewing on that side; apply cold compresses. Seek dental care ASAP. |\n\n---\n\n## How to Perform a Basic Self\u2011Inspection\n\n1. **Visual Check**  \n   *Hold a bright light or flashlight over the tooth.  \n   *Look for:  \n     - Visible cracks or chips.  \n     - Rough or missing edges where the filling was.  \n     - Color changes (darkening, yellowing).  \n     - Swelling or redness of the surrounding gum.\n\n2. **Gentle Pressure Test**  \n   *Using the tip of a clean finger, lightly press along the chewing surface.  \n   *If it feels **soft** or **bouncy**, it might be a fracture or a cavity that has softened the tooth structure.  \n   *If it feels **solid** but painful, a filling might be missing or loose.\n\n3. **Temperature Test**  \n   *Hold a warm (not hot) cloth or a piece of warm food (like a slice of bread) against the tooth for 10\u202fseconds.  \n   *Hold a cold object (like a chilled gel pack or ice cube wrapped in a cloth) for 10\u202fseconds.  \n   *Note:  \n     - **Sharp pain on warm** \u2192 likely a **cavity** or **missing filling**.  \n     - **Sharp pain on cold** \u2192 could be a **fracture** or a **deep decay**.  \n     - **No pain** \u2192 the tooth is likely intact; other symptoms may be elsewhere.\n\n4. **Swallow & Breathing Test**  \n   *Try swallowing a small mouthful of water.  \n   *If you feel pain, especially in the back of the throat or jaw, consider a possible abscess.\n\n5. **Check Your Mouth for Fluid**  \n   *If you see pus, saliva, or a foul taste, an infection is almost certainly present.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Safe\u2011House Actions\n\n| Situation | Immediate Action | Why It Helps |\n|-----------|------------------|--------------|\n| **Missing or loose filling** | Rinse mouth, apply cold compress to the cheek. If you have dental wax or temporary dental cement (often found in pharmacies), place it carefully over the cavity. | Reduces exposure and pain, temporarily seals the tooth. |\n| **Fractured tooth** | Apply a cold pack, do not chew on that side. Use OTC pain relievers. | Minimizes swelling and protects the exposed nerve. |\n| **Possible abscess** | Go to urgent care or an emergency department. While traveling, keep the area clean and apply a cold compress. | Professional drainage or antibiotics are required to prevent spread. |\n| **Pain that persists >24\u202fh** | Continue cold compresses and OTC medication. Call your dentist or find the nearest dental office even if it\u2019s outside normal hours. | Long\u2011lasting pain usually indicates infection or nerve involvement. |\n\n---\n\n## When to Seek Professional Help Immediately\n\n- Pain that **spreads** to your ear, neck, or throat.  \n- Swelling that **enlarges** or you notice difficulty swallowing.  \n- **Fever**, chills, or a feeling of overall illness.  \n- You can\u2019t keep fluids down or you\u2019re vomiting.  \n- Any **signs of a spreading infection** (redness that moves beyond the gum line, pus).  \n- Severe or sudden **difficulty breathing**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a remote area with no immediate medical help, call emergency services (e.g., 911 in the U.S.) and explain that you have a dental emergency. In many countries, a local hospital will have an ENT (ear, nose, throat) team that can manage dental abscesses.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n1. **Look, press, and test** to see if the tooth feels cracked, loose, or has a missing filling.  \n2. **Check for swelling, pus, or a foul taste**\u2014these are red flags for infection.  \n3. Use **cold compresses** and **OTC pain relievers** while you\u2019re waiting.  \n4. **Never chew on the affected side** if you suspect a fracture or deep cavity.  \n5. If the pain is severe, the tooth is loose, or there are signs of infection, **seek urgent professional help** immediately\u2014no dental office is \u201cnot available\u201d when an abscess is present.\n\n**Safety first:** if at any point you feel faint, short\u2011of\u2011breath, or otherwise unwell, call emergency services right away.", "context": "16.

If it\u2019s tender or you see redness/swelling, it\u2019s gum-related. |\n| **Redness, swelling, or bleeding gums** | Gum disease | Look at your gums in a well\u2011lit mirror. Bleeding when you brush or floss is a classic sign. |\n| **Bad breath, a foul taste, or visible plaque** | Gum disease | Rinse or swab the area; a sour or metallic taste often comes with gum issues. |\n| **Loose or floating tooth** | Advanced gum disease or root infection | Try to wiggle the tooth lightly.

Cut a 18\u201124\u202fin. length. 2. Wrap the middle between thumb and middle finger. 3. Slide the floss back & forth, gently rocking the teeth. 4. Repeat on each side. | Do **not** use string that frays or has rough edges; it can tear the gum. |\n| **Dental\u2011tape or \u201ctissue\u201d floss** (e.g., a clean tissue\u2011paper strip, a folded piece of thin cardboard, or a paper towel strip) | Slightly wider, but still flexible enough for interdental cleaning | 1. Cut a strip about 0.5\u202fmm\u2011wide. 2. Wrap as above and slide. 3. After each use, replace to avoid bacteria buildup. | Avoid thick, stiff paper that can tear your gums. |\n| **Dental pick or toothpick** (a small wooden or plastic stick) | A slender, pointed tool that can scoop out debris | 1. Gently insert the tip between teeth, moving the pick up and down. 2. Do not force or twist it\u2014just light scooping. | Never use a sharp, rough\u2011cut pick that could cut gums or chip enamel. |\n| **Clean cotton swab or Q\u2011tip** (no cotton tip if possible) | The shaft is long enough to reach between teeth and is soft enough to not damage gums | 1. Hold the shaft with fingers. 2. Slide it gently between teeth in a back\u2011and\u2011forth motion. | Avoid cotton\u2011tipped swabs\u2014cotton can leave fibers behind and the tip is too thick for tight spaces. |\n| **Soft\u2011bristled toothbrush (second brush)** | You can press the tiny bristles between teeth or use the tip to scrape | 1.

{"instruction": "How can I stay calm and avoid panic during a severe asthma attack?", "response": "**Short answer**  \nWhen you\u2019re in the middle of a severe asthma attack and you can\u2019t reach a rescue inhaler, the single most important thing is *stay as calm as possible* so you can keep breathing and think clearly. Use a combination of breathing techniques, grounding strategies, and practical actions that can help you stay afloat until help arrives or you can get a relief medication.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Stop the panic loop \u2013 the first 30\u202fseconds\n| Step | What to do | Why it helps |\n|------|------------|--------------|\n| **1. Sit up straight** (or lean forward if sitting is hard). | Reduces pressure on your chest. | Improves airflow. |\n| **2. Count in your head: \u201cOne, two, three, four\u2026.\u201d** | Gives your mind a simple task. | Diverts attention from fear. |\n| **3. Close your eyes if it feels safe** | Prevents you from staring at the clock or phone. | Reduces visual overload. |\n| **4. Don\u2019t look at your inhaler until you find it** | Looking for it can amplify anxiety. | Keeps focus on breathing. |\n| **5. Remind yourself: \u201cI\u2019m breathing. I\u2019ll get help.\u201d** | Positive self\u2011talk. | Calms the nervous system. |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Breathing technique that works on the spot\n\n**4\u20117\u20118 Technique (adapted for asthma)**  \n\n1. **Inhale** quietly through the nose for *4 seconds*.  \n2. **Hold** the breath (if you can) for *7 seconds* \u2013 *or* as long as feels comfortable, up to 5\u202fseconds.  \n3. **Exhale** slowly through the mouth for *8 seconds*.  \n4. Repeat **3\u20134 times**.\n\n*Why it helps:*  \n- The slow exhale dilates the bronchi.  \n- Holding briefly gives the airway time to relax.  \n- The rhythm slows the heart rate and reduces panic.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Grounding / \u201c5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111\u201d technique\n\nWhile you\u2019re breathing, ground yourself with sensory cues.\n\n| Sense | What to do | Example |\n|-------|------------|---------|\n| Sight | Identify **5 things** you can see. | A picture, a window, a pen. |\n| Touch | Notice **4 things** you can touch. | The chair, your phone, the carpet. |\n| Hearing | List **3 sounds** you hear. | The hum of the fridge, a passing car. |\n| Smell | Notice **2 scents**. | Coffee, soap, the air. |\n| Taste | Think of **1 taste** (if you have something). | A sip of water, a piece of fruit. |\n\n*Why it helps:*  \nIt pulls your attention away from panic thoughts and into the present moment, which slows the \u201cfight\u2011or\u2011flight\u201d response.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Practical actions to get help / relief\n\n| Action | How to do it | Why it matters |\n|--------|--------------|----------------|\n| **Call emergency services (911/999/etc.)** | Use your phone or ask a neighbor. | Medical professionals can bring oxygen, nebulizer, or a rescue inhaler. |\n| **Seek a neighbor\u2019s or friend\u2019s inhaler** | Ask politely, \u201cI\u2019m having a severe attack; can you lend me your inhaler?\u201d | A rescue inhaler is the most effective immediate relief. |\n| **Use a nebulizer if available** | If you live in a hospital or a clinic nearby, a nebulizer can deliver fast relief. | Nebulizers work even if you can\u2019t use a puffer. |\n| **Open a window or use a fan** | Bring in fresh air. | Fresh air can help reduce the feeling of suffocation. |\n| **Avoid lying flat** | Stay seated or slightly upright. | Reduces pressure on the diaphragm. |\n| **Drink a glass of water (if you\u2019re not choking)** | Hydrates, but keep the amount small. | Prevents dehydration during stress. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. When you\u2019re at the edge of a full crisis\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to breathe even a short breath or you feel chest tightness that\u2019s worsening:\n\n1. **Sit or stand as upright as possible.**  \n2. **Apply gentle pressure to the back** (e.g., a cushion or a pillow) if you can.  \n3. **Do not hold your breath** \u2013 keep the 4\u20117\u20118 rhythm or a slower rhythm like 5\u201110\u20115.  \n4. **Keep talking to yourself**: \u201cI\u2019m safe. I\u2019m getting help.\u201d  \n5. **Call 911** if you haven\u2019t already and keep speaking to the dispatcher until an ambulance arrives.\n\n---\n\n## 6. After the immediate crisis\n\nOnce the emergency team arrives or you\u2019re stable enough:\n\n- **Tell the medical staff** that you couldn\u2019t use your rescue inhaler.  \n- **Get a backup plan**: prescription for a second inhaler, a personal medical alert bracelet, or a plan for having a spare inhaler in a designated \u201cfirst\u2011aid\u201d box.  \n- **Schedule a follow\u2011up** with your asthma action plan doctor to adjust medications or add a new rescue inhaler.\n\n---\n\n### Quick checklist (for when panic starts):\n\n1. Sit upright \u2192 2. Count \u2192 3. Close eyes \u2192 4. 4\u20117\u20118 breathe \u2192 5. 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 ground \u2192 6. Call help / get inhaler \u2192 7. Keep talking to yourself \u2192 8. Stay calm until help arrives.\n\n---\n\n**Remember:** Panic can worsen breathing. By following the breathing and grounding steps above, you create a mental \u201cbuffer\u201d that helps your body breathe more efficiently while you wait for rescue inhaler or professional help. If at any point you feel you cannot breathe or your chest pain worsens dramatically, **call emergency services immediately**. You are not alone\u2014help is almost always just a phone call away.", "context": "17. A person is having a severe asthma attack when their rescue inhaler is empty, lost, or unavailable."}

I\u2019d like to keep one at work and one at home.\u201d |\n| **Request a written asthma action plan** | A personalized plan tells you exactly when to use rescue medication, when to start or increase controller meds, and when to seek emergency help. | \u201cI\u2019d like a copy of my action plan, ideally with clear trigger lists and peak\u2011flow guidelines.\u201d |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Medication Management\n\n| Task | Details |\n|------|---------|\n| **Check inhaler technique** | Incorrect technique reduces drug delivery. Ask your provider to demonstrate or watch a short instructional video (e.g., on the device\u2019s website). |\n| **Verify controller medication** | If you\u2019re on a daily inhaled steroid or long\u2011acting bronchodilator, ensure the dose matches your latest assessment. |\n| **Set up medication reminders** | Use a pill\u2011box with separate compartments for each day, or set phone alarms for your doses. |\n| **Keep inhalers in a \u201cready\u2011to\u2011go\u201d location** | Attach one to your wallet or backpack, keep a spare in your car, and store the primary inhaler in a cool, dry place. |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Identify and Mitigate Triggers\n\n1. **Common triggers**  \n   * Allergens (pollen, dust mites, mold, pet dander)  \n   * Smoke (tobacco or wood smoke)  \n   * Air pollution / cold air  \n   * Strong odors (perfume, cleaning products)  \n   * Respiratory infections (cold, flu)\n\n2. **Action plan**  \n   * **Allergens**: Use HEPA filters, keep windows closed in spring/summer, wash bedding weekly in hot water, vacuum with a HEPA filter.  \n   * **Smoke**: Ensure no one smokes indoors; keep doors closed to smoking areas.  \n   * **Cold air**: Wear a scarf or mask over your nose/mouth when outside in cold weather.  \n   * **Odors**: Keep strong fragrances and cleaning chemicals sealed; opt for fragrance\u2011free products.  \n   * **Infections**: Get your flu shot, practice good hand hygiene, and consider wearing a mask in crowds during flu season.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Monitoring and Peak\u2011Flow Tracking\n\n1. **Peak\u2011flow meter** \u2013 A simple device that measures how fast air leaves your lungs.  \n2. **Track readings** \u2013 Record twice daily (morning and evening) and note any changes.  \n3. **Use readings in your action plan** \u2013 Most plans include \u201cgood,\u201d \u201ccaution,\u201d and \u201cpoor\u201d thresholds to trigger medication adjustments or medical visits.  \n\n---\n\n## 5. Lifestyle Adjustments\n\n| Habit | Why It Helps |\n|-------|--------------|\n| **Regular exercise** (as tolerated) | Improves lung capacity and overall fitness. |\n| **Healthy diet** | Supports immune function; avoid foods that trigger allergies (e.g., certain fruits). |\n| **Weight management** | Reduces pressure on lungs and improves breathing. |\n| **Stress reduction** (yoga, meditation, deep\u2011breathing exercises) | Stress can worsen asthma symptoms. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Emergency Preparedness\n\n| What to Do | Who to Call | When to Call |\n|------------|------------|--------------|\n| **Severe breathing difficulty** | 911 (or local emergency number) | If you can\u2019t breathe, wheeze loudly, have a blue\u2011tinged lips or face, or if you\u2019re unable to speak in full sentences. |\n| **Uncontrolled cough or chest tightness** | Your primary doctor | If symptoms are worsening despite rescue inhaler use. |\n| **Missed doses or new medications** | Your provider | Before the next dose is due. |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Follow\u2011Up Timeline\n\n| Timeframe | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Within 24\u201348\u202fhrs** | Call provider, get prescription refill, arrange for a spare inhaler. |\n| **Within 1\u202fweek** | Review inhaler technique, get a new written action plan, start tracking peak\u2011flow if not already. |\n| **Monthly** | Review medication adherence, check for side effects, update trigger list. |\n| **Every 6\u201312\u202fmonths** | Annual check\u2011up with pulmonologist or allergist (if you have one). |\n\n---\n\n## 8.
